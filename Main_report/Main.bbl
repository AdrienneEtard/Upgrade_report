    Charisma is a term commonly used in conservation biology to describe
  species. However, as the term “charismatic species” has never been
  properly defined, it needs to be better characterized to fully meet its
  potential in conservation biology. To provide a more complete depiction, we
  collected information from four different sources to define the species
  currently considered to be the most charismatic and to understand what they
  represent to the Western public. First, we asked respondents of two separate
  surveys to identify the 10 animal species that they considered to be the most
  charismatic and associate them with one to six traits: Rare, Endangered,
  Beautiful, Cute, Impressive, and Dangerous. We then identified the wild
  animals featured on the website homepages of the zoos situated in the world's
  100 largest cities as well as on the film posters of all Disney and Pixar
  films, assuming in both cases that the most charismatic species were
  generally chosen to attract viewers. By combining the four approaches, we set
  up a ranked list of the 20 most charismatic animals. The majority are large
  exotic, terrestrial mammals. These species were deemed charismatic, mainly
  because they were regarded as beautiful, impressive, or endangered, although
  no particular trait was discriminated, and species were heterogeneously
  associated with most of the traits. The main social characteristics of
  respondents did not have a significant effect on their choices. These results
  provide a concrete list of the most charismatic species and offer insights
  into the Western public's perception of charismatic species, both of which
  could be helpful to target new species for conservation campaigns.%

    Concern is growing about the consequences of biodiversity loss for
  ecosystem functioning, for the provision of ecosystem services, and for human
  well being. Experimental evidence for a relationship between biodiversity and
  ecosystem process rates is compelling, but the issue remains contentious.
  Here, we present the first rigorous quantitative assessment of this
  relationship through meta-analysis of experimental work spanning 50 years to
  June 2004. We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in
  grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or
  measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if
  biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity
  change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community
  level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects
  decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements
  manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures
  ('insurance' effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on
  performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed
  here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most.
  Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to
  biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.%

    Theory on trophic interactions predicts that predators increase plant
  biomass by feeding on herbivores, an indirect interaction called a trophic
  cascade. Theory also predicts that predators feeding on predators, or
  intraguild predation, will weaken trophic cascades. Although past syntheses
  have confirmed cascading effects of terrestrial arthropod predators, we lack
  a comprehensive analysis for vertebrate insectivores-which by virtue of their
  body size and feeding habits are often top predators in these systems-and of
  how intraguild predation mediates trophic cascade strength. We report here on
  a meta-analysis of 113 experiments documenting the effects of insectivorous
  birds, bats, or lizards on predaceous arthropods, herbivorous arthropods, and
  plants. Although vertebrate insectivores fed as intraguild predators,
  strongly reducing predaceous arthropods (38%), they nevertheless suppressed
  herbivores (39%), indirectly reduced plant damage (40%), and increased plant
  biomass (14%). Furthermore, effects of vertebrate insectivores on predatory
  and herbivorous arthropods were positively correlated. Effects were strongest
  on arthropods and plants in communities with abundant predaceous arthropods
  and strong intraguild predation, but weak in communities depauperate in
  arthropod predators and intraguild predation. The naturally occurring ratio
  of arthropod predators relative to herbivores varied tremendously among the
  studied communities, and the skew to predators increased with site primary
  productivity and in trees relative to shrubs. Although intraguild predation
  among arthropod predators has been shown to weaken herbivore suppression, we
  find this paradigm does not extend to vertebrate insectivores in these
  communities. Instead, vertebrate intraguild preda-tion is associated with
  strengthened trophic cascades, and insectivores function as dominant
  predators in terrestrial plant-arthropod communities.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Many species have already shifted their distributions in response to recent
  climate change. Here, we aimed at predicting the future breeding
  distributions of European birds under climate, land-use, and dispersal
  scenarios. We predicted current and future distributions of 409 species
  within an ensemble forecast framework using seven species distribution models
  (SDMs), five climate scenarios and three emission and land-use scenarios. We
  then compared results from SDMs using climate-only variables, habitat-only
  variables or both climate and habitat variables. In order to account for a
  species' dispersal abilities, we used natal dispersal estimates and developed
  a probabilistic method that produced a dispersal scenario intermediate
  between the null and full dispersal scenarios generally considered in such
  studies. We then compared results from all scenarios in terms of future
  predicted range changes, range shifts, and variations in species richness.
  Modeling accuracy was better with climate-only variables than with
  habitat-only variables, and better with both climate and habitat variables.
  Habitat models predicted smaller range shifts and smaller variations in range
  size and species richness than climate models. Using both climate and habitat
  variables, it was predicted that the range of 71% of the species would
  decrease by 2050, with a 335 km median shift. Predicted variations in species
  richness showed large decreases in the southern regions of Europe, as well as
  increases, mainly in Scandinavia and northern Russia. The partial dispersal
  scenario was significantly different from the full dispersal scenario for 25%
  of the species, resulting in the local reduction of the future predicted
  species richness of up to 10%. We concluded that the breeding range of most
  European birds will decrease in spite of dispersal abilities close to a full
  dispersal hypothesis, and that given the contrasted predictions obtained when
  modeling climate change only and land-use change only, both scenarios must be
  taken into consideration. 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.%

    Effective and targeted conservation action requires detailed information
  about species, their distribution, systematics and ecology as well as the
  distribution of threat processes which affect them. Knowledge of reptilian
  diversity remains surprisingly disparate, and innovative means of gaining
  rapid insight into the status of reptiles are needed in order to highlight
  urgent conservation cases and inform environmental policy with appropriate
  biodiversity information in a timely manner. We present the first ever global
  analysis of extinction risk in reptiles, based on a random representative
  sample of 1500 species (16% of all currently known species). To our
  knowledge, our results provide the first analysis of the global conservation
  status and distribution patterns of reptiles and the threats affecting them,
  highlighting conservation priorities and knowledge gaps which need to be
  addressed urgently to ensure the continued survival of the world's reptiles.
  Nearly one in five reptilian species are threatened with extinction, with
  another one in five species classed as Data Deficient. The proportion of
  threatened reptile species is highest in freshwater environments, tropical
  regions and on oceanic islands, while data deficiency was highest in tropical
  areas, such as Central Africa and Southeast Asia, and among fossorial
  reptiles. Our results emphasise the need for research attention to be
  focussed on tropical areas which are experiencing the most dramatic rates of
  habitat loss, on fossorial reptiles for which there is a chronic lack of
  data, and on certain taxa such as snakes for which extinction risk may
  currently be underestimated due to lack of population information.
  Conservation actions specifically need to mitigate the effects of
  human-induced habitat loss and harvesting, which are the predominant threats
  to reptiles. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.%

    Natural populations consist of phenotypically diverse individuals that
  exhibit variation in their demographic parameters and intra- and
  inter-specific interactions. Recent experimental work indicates that such
  variation can have significant ecological effects. However, ecological models
  typically disregard this variation and focus instead on trait means and total
  population density. Under what situations is this simplification appropriate?
  Why might intraspecific variation alter ecological dynamics? In this review
  we synthesize recent theory and identify six general mechanisms by which
  trait variation changes the outcome of ecological interactions. These
  mechanisms include several direct effects of trait variation per se and
  indirect effects arising from the role of genetic variation in trait
  evolution. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.%

    MotivationDetermining whether a trait and phylogeny share some degree of
  phylogenetic signal is a flagship goal in evolutionary biology. Signatures of
  phylogenetic signal can assist the resolution of a broad range of
  evolutionary questions regarding the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution.
  However, despite the considerable number of strategies to measure it, few and
  limited approaches exist for categorical traits. Here, we used the concept of
  Shannon entropy and propose the $\delta$ statistic for evaluating the degree
  of phylogenetic signal between a phylogeny and categorical traits.ResultsWe
  validated $\delta$ as a measure of phylogenetic signal: the higher the
  $\delta$-value the higher the degree of phylogenetic signal between a given
  tree and a trait. Based on simulated data we proposed a threshold-based
  classification test to pinpoint cases of phylogenetic signal. The assessment
  of the test's specificity and sensitivity suggested that the $\delta$
  approach should only be applied to 20 or more species. We have further tested
  the performance of $\delta$ in scenarios of branch length and topology
  uncertainty, unbiased and biased trait evolution and trait saturation. Our
  results showed that $\delta$ may be applied in a wide range of phylogenetic
  contexts. Finally, we investigated our method in 14 360 mammalian gene trees
  and found that olfactory receptor genes are significantly associated with the
  mammalian activity patterns, a result that is congruent with expectations and
  experiments from the literature. Our application shows that $\delta$ can
  successfully detect molecular signatures of phenotypic evolution. We conclude
  that $\delta$ represents a useful measure of the strength of phylogenetic
  signal since many phenotypes can only be measured in
  categories.Availabilityhttps://github.com/mrborges23/delta_statisticSupplementary

    Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree
  depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the
  same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for
  forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest
  becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers
  depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the
  correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each
  node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Freund and
  Schapire[1996]), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal
  estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show
  the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.
  Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas
  are also applicable to regression. 1%

    A wealth of information on metabolic parameters of a species can be
  inferred from observations on species that are phylogenetically related.
  Phylogeny-based information can complement direct empirical evidence, and is
  particularly valuable if experiments on the species of interest are not
  feasible. The PhyloPars web server provides a statistically consistent method
  that combines an incomplete set of empirical observations with the species
  phylogeny to produce a complete set of parameter estimates for all species.
  It builds upon a state-of-the-art evolutionary model, extended with the
  ability to handle missing data. The resulting approach makes optimal use of
  all available information to produce estimates that can be an order of
  magnitude more accurate than ad-hoc alternatives. Uploading a phylogeny and
  incomplete feature matrix suffices to obtain estimates of all missing values,
  along with a measure of certainty. Real-time cross-validation provides
  further insight in the accuracy and bias expected for estimated values. The
  server allows for easy, efficient estimation of metabolic parameters, which
  can benefit a wide range of fields including systems biology and ecology.

    1. The geographical range sizes of individual species vary considerably in
  extent, although the factors underlying this variation remain poorly
  understood, and could include a number of ecological and evolutionary
  processes. A favoured explanation for range size variation is that this
  result from differences in fundamental niche breadths, suggesting a key role
  for physiology in determining range size, although to date empirical tests of
  these ideas remain limited. 2. Here we explore relationships between thermal
  physiology and biogeography, whilst controlling for possible differences in
  dispersal ability and phylogenetic relatedness, across 14 ecologically
  similar congeners which differ in geographical range extent; European diving
  beetles of the genus Deronectes Sharp (Coleoptera, Dytiscidae). Absolute
  upper and lower temperature tolerance and acclimatory abilities are
  determined for populations of each species, following acclimation in the
  laboratory. 3. Absolute thermal tolerance range is the best predictor of both
  species' latitudinal range extent and position, differences in dispersal
  ability (based on wing size) apparently being less important in this group.
  In addition, species' northern and southern range limits are related to their
  tolerance of low and high temperatures respectively. In all cases, absolute
  temperature tolerances, rather than acclimatory abilities are the best
  predictors of range parameters, whilst the use of independent contrasts
  suggested that species' thermal acclimation abilities may also relate to
  biogeography, although increased acclimatory ability does not appear to be
  associated with increased range size. 4. Our study is the first to provide
  empirical support for a relationship between thermal physiology and range
  size variation in widespread and restricted species, conducted using the same
  experimental design, within a phylogenetically and ecologically controlled
  framework.%

    Large floristic datasets that purportedly represent the diversity and
  composition of the Amazon tree flora are being widely used to draw
  conclusions about the patterns and evolution of Amazon plant diversity, but
  these datasets are fundamentally flawed in both their methodology and the
  resulting content. We have assembled a comprehensive dataset of Amazonian
  seed plant species from published sources that includes falsifiable data
  based on voucher specimens identified by taxonomic specialists. This growing
  list should serve as a basis for addressing the long-standing debate on the
  number of plant species in the Amazon, as well as for downstream ecological
  and evolutionary analyses aimed at understanding the origin and function of
  the exceptional biodiversity of the vast Amazonian forests.Recent debates on
  the number of plant species in the vast lowland rain forests of the Amazon
  have been based largely on model estimates, neglecting published checklists
  based on verified voucher data. Here we collate taxonomically verified
  checklists to present a list of seed plant species from lowland Amazon rain
  forests. Our list comprises 14,003 species, of which 6,727 are trees. These
  figures are similar to estimates derived from nonparametric ecological
  models, but they contrast strongly with predictions of much higher tree
  diversity derived from parametric models. Based on the known proportion of
  tree species in neotropical lowland rain forest communities as measured in
  complete plot censuses, and on overall estimates of seed plant diversity in
  Brazil and in the neotropics in general, it is more likely that tree
  diversity in the Amazon is closer to the lower estimates derived from
  nonparametric models. Much remains unknown about Amazonian plant diversity,
  but this taxonomically verified dataset provides a valid starting point for
  macroecological and evolutionary studies aimed at understanding the origin,
  evolution, and ecology of the exceptional biodiversity of Amazonian forests.%

    Owing to the conceptual complexity of functional diversity (FD), a
  multitude of different methods are available for measuring it, with most
  being operational at only a small range of spatial scales. This causes
  uncertainty in ecological interpretations and limits the potential to
  generalize findings across studies or compare patterns across scales. We
  solve this problem by providing a unified framework expanding on and
  integrating existing approaches. The framework, based on trait probability
  density (TPD), is the first to fully implement the Hutchinsonian concept of
  the niche as a probabilistic hypervolume in estimating FD. This novel
  approach could revolutionize FD-based research by allowing quantification of
  the various FD components from organismal to macroecological scales, and
  allowing seamless transitions between scales. Functional trait diversity, in
  other words the variation of traits between organisms, can be used to address
  a great number of pressing ecological questions. Consequently, trait-based
  approaches are increasingly being used by ecologists.However, functional
  diversity comprises several components that can be evaluated at different
  spatial scales. Because of this conceptual complexity, there is an
  overabundance of disparate approaches for estimating it, which leads to
  confusion among users and hampers the comparability of different studies.A
  single mathematical framework encompassing different approaches while
  providing a seamless continuity between spatial scales is needed.Reconciling
  the approaches based on the concept of the niche as a hypervolume and those
  that consider traits in probabilistic terms is the first step towards the
  foundation of a unified framework.%

    Top carnivores have suffered widespread global declines, with
  well-documented effects on mesopredators and herbivores. We know less about
  how carnivores affect ecosystems through scavenging. Tasmania's top
  carnivore, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), has suffered severe
  disease-induced population declines, providing a natural experiment on the
  role of scavenging in structuring communities. Using remote cameras and
  experimentally placed carcasses, we show that mesopredators consume more
  carrion in areas where devils have declined. Carcass consumption by the two
  native mesopredators was best predicted by competition for carrion, whereas
  consumption by the invasive mesopredator, the feral cat (Felis catus), was
  better predicted by the landscape-level abundance of devils, suggesting a
  relaxed landscape of fear where devils are suppressed. Reduced discovery of
  carcasses by devils was balanced by the increased discovery by mesopredators.
  Nonetheless, carcasses persisted approximately 2.6-fold longer where devils
  have declined, highlighting their importance for rapid carrion removal. The
  major beneficiary of increased carrion availability was the forest raven
  (Corvus tasmanicus). Population trends of ravens increased 2.2-fold from 1998
  to 2017, the period of devil decline, but this increase occurred
  Tasmania-wide, making the cause unclear. This case study provides a
  little-studied potential mechanism for mesopredator release, with broad
  relevance to the vast areas of the world that have suffered carnivore
  declines.%

    Human activity is causing wild populations to experience rapid trait change
  and local extirpation. The resulting effects on intraspecific variation could
  have substantial consequences for ecological processes and ecosystem
  services. Although researchers have long acknowledged that variation among
  species influences the surrounding environment, only recently has evidence
  accumulated for the ecological importance of variation within species. We
  conducted a meta-analysis comparing the ecological effects of variation
  within a species (intraspecific effects) with the effects of replacement or
  removal of that species (species effects). We evaluated direct and indirect
  ecological responses, including changes in abundance (or biomass), rates of
  ecological processes and changes in community composition. Our results show
  that intraspecific effects are often comparable to, and sometimes stronger
  than, species effects. Species effects tend to be larger for direct
  ecological responses (for example, through consumption), whereas
  intraspecific effects and species effects tend to be similar for indirect
  responses (for example, through trophic cascades). Intraspecific effects are
  especially strong when indirect interactions alter community composition. Our
  results summarize data from the first generation of studies examining the
  relative ecological effects of intraspecific variation. Our conclusions can
  help inform the design of future experiments and the formulation of
  strategies to quantify and conserve biodiversity.%

    Among the statistical methods available to control for phylogenetic
  autocorrelation in ecological data, those based on eigenfunction analysis of
  the phylogenetic distance matrix among the species are becoming increasingly
  important tools. Here, we evaluate a range of criteria to select eigenvectors
  extracted from a phylogenetic distance matrix (using phylogenetic eigenvector
  regression, PVR) that can be used to measure the level of phylogenetic signal
  in ecological data and to study correlated evolution. We used a principal
  coordinate analysis to represent the phylogenetic relationships among 209
  species of Carnivora by a series of eigenvectors, which were then used to
  model log-transformed body size. We first conducted a series of PVRs in which
  we increased the number of eigenvectors from 1 to 70, following the sequence
  of their associated eigenvalues. Second, we also investigated three
  non-sequential approaches based on the selection of 1) eigenvectors
  significantly correlated with body size, 2) eigenvectors selected by a
  standard stepwise algorithm, and 3) the combination of eigenvectors that
  minimizes the residual phylogenetic autocorrelation. We mapped the mean
  specific component of body size to evaluate how these selection criteria
  affect the interpretation of non-phylogenetic signal in Bergmann's rule. For
  comparison, the same patterns were analyzed using autoregressive model (ARM)
  and phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS). Despite the robustness of
  PVR to the specific approaches used to select eigenvectors, using a
  relatively small number of eigenvectors may be insufficient to control
  phylogenetic autocorrelation, leading to flawed conclusions about patterns
  and processes. The method that minimizes residual autocorrelation seems to be
  the best choice according to different criteria. Thus, our analyses show
  that, when the best criterion is used to control phylogenetic structure, PVR
  can be a valuable tool for testing hypotheses related to heritability at the
  species level, phylogenetic niche conservatism and correlated evolution
  between ecological traits. -� 2011 The Authors. Ecography -� 2012 Nordic

    Whereas previous studies have investigated correlates of extinction risk
  either at global or regional scales, our study explicitly models regional
  effects of anthropogenic threats and biological traits across the globe.
  Using phylogenetic comparative methods with a newly-updated supertree of 5020
  extant mammals, we investigate the impact of species traits on extinction
  risk within each WWF ecoregion. Our analyses reveal strong geographical
  variation in the influence of traits on risk: notably, larger species are at
  higher risk only in tropical regions. We then relate these patterns to
  current and recent-historical human impacts across ecoregions usin g spatial
  modelling. The body-mass results apparently reflect historical declines of
  large species outside the tropics due to large-scale land conversion.
  Narrow-ranged and rare species tend to be at high risk in areas of high
  current human impacts. The interactions we describe between biological traits
  and anthropogenic threats increase understanding of the processes determining
  extinction risk.%

    Diet is a key trait of an organism's life history that influences a broad
  spectrum of ecological and evolutionary processes. Kissling et al. (2014;
  Ecology and Evolution 4: 2913–2930) compiled a species-specific data set of
  diet preferences of mammals for 38% of a total of 5364 terrestrial mammalian
  species assessed for the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red
  List, to facilitate future studies. The authors imputed dietary data for the
  remaining 62% by using extrapolation from phylogenetic relatives. We
  collected dietary information for 1261 mammalian species for which data were
  extrapolated by Kissling et al. (2014), in order to evaluate the success with
  which such extrapolation can predict true diets. The extrapolation method
  devised by Kissling et al. (2014) performed well for broad dietary categories
  (consumers of plants and animals). However, the method performed
  inconsistently, and sometimes poorly, for finer dietary categories, varying
  in accuracy in both dietary categories and mammalian orders. The results of
  the extrapolation performance serve as a cautionary tale. Given the large
  variation in extrapolation performance, we recommend a more conservative
  approach for inferring mammalian diets, whereby dietary extrapolation is
  implemented only when there is a high degree of phylogenetic conservatism for
  dietary traits. Phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to detect and
  measure phylogenetic signal in diet. If data for species are needed, then
  only the broadest feeding categories should be used. This would ensure a
  greater level of accuracy and provide a more robust data set for further
  ecological and evolutionary analysis.%

    Anthropogenic degradation of the world's ecosystems is leading to a
  widespread and accelerating loss of biodiversity. However, not all species
  respond equally to existing threats, raising the question: what makes a
  species more vulnerable to extinction? We propose that higher intraspecific
  variability may reduce the risk of extinction, as different individuals and
  populations within a species may respond differently to occurring threats.
  Supporting this prediction, our results show that mammalian species with more
  variable adult body masses, litter sizes, sexual maturity ages and population
  densities are less vulnerable to extinction. Our findings reveal the role of
  local variation among populations, particularly of large mammals, as a
  buffering mechanism against extinction, and emphasise the importance of
  considering trait variation in comparative analyses and conservation
  management.%

    1. Comparative analyses are used to address the key question of what makes
  a species more prone to extinction by exploring the links between
  vulnerability and intrinsic species' traits and/or extrinsic factors. This
  approach requires comprehensive species data but information is rarely
  available for all species of interest. As a result comparative analyses often
  rely on subsets of relatively few species that are assumed to be
  representative samples of the overall studied group. 2. Our study challenges
  this assumption and quantifies the taxonomic, spatial, and data type biases
  associated with the quantity of data available for 5415 mammalian species
  using the freely available life-history database PanTHERIA. 3. Moreover, we
  explore how existing biases influence results of comparative analyses of
  extinction risk by using subsets of data that attempt to correct for detected
  biases. In particular, we focus on links between four species' traits
  commonly linked to vulnerability (distribution range area, adult body mass,
  population density and gestation length) and conduct univariate and
  multivariate analyses to understand how biases affect model predictions. 4.
  Our results show important biases in data availability with c.22% of mammals
  completely lacking data. Missing data, which appear to be not missing at
  random, occur frequently in all traits (14-99% of cases missing). Data
  availability is explained by intrinsic traits, with larger mammals occupying
  bigger range areas being the best studied. Importantly, we find that existing
  biases affect the results of comparative analyses by overestimating the risk
  of extinction and changing which traits are identified as important
  predictors. 5. Our results raise concerns over our ability to draw general
  conclusions regarding what makes a species more prone to extinction. Missing
  data represent a prevalent problem in comparative analyses, and
  unfortunately, because data are not missing at random, conventional
  approaches to fill data gaps, are not valid or present important challenges.
  These results show the importance of making appropriate inferences from
  comparative analyses by focusing on the subset of species for which data are
  available. Ultimately, addressing the data bias problem requires greater
  investment in data collection and dissemination, as well as the development
  of methodological approaches to effectively correct existing biases.%

    There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize
  the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have
  been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize
  the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs,
  pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the
  ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative
  method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to
  find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is,
  however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs
  to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more
  functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better
  ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply
  readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable
  metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster
  a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first
  distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource
  extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and
  the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then
  discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as
  niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the
  negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both
  exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most
  of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on
  food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic
  representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore,
  conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians
  and empiricists.%

    Genomic data are rapidly resolving the tree of living species calibrated to
  time, the timetree of life, which will provide a framework for research in
  diverse fields of science. Previous analyses of taxonomically restricted
  timetrees have found a decline in the rate of diversification in many groups
  of organisms, often attributed to ecological interactions among species.
  Here, we have synthesized a global timetree of life from 2,274 studies
  representing 50,632 species and examined the pattern and rate of
  diversification as well as the timing of speciation. We found that species
  diversity has been mostly expanding overall and in many smaller groups of
  species, and that the rate of diversification in eukaryotes has been mostly
  constant. We also identified, and avoided, potential biases that may have
  influenced previous analyses of diversification including low levels of taxon
  sampling, small clade size, and the inclusion of stem branches in clade
  analyses. We found consistency in time-to-speciation among plants and
  animals, ∼2 My, as measured by intervals of crown and stem species times.
  Together, this clock-like change at different levels suggests that speciation
  and diversification are processes dominated by random events and that
  adaptive change is largely a separate process.%

    Understanding the responses of biodiversity to drivers of change and the
  effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties and ecosystem services is a
  key challenge in the context of global environmental change. We performed a
  systematic review and meta- analysis of the scientific literature linking
  direct drivers of change and ecosystem services via functional traits of
  three taxonomic groups (vegetation, invertebrates, and vertebrates) to: (1)
  uncover trends and research biases in this field; and (2) synthesize existing
  empirical evidence. Our results show the existence of important biases in
  published studies related to ecosystem types, taxonomic groups, direct
  drivers of change, ecosystem services, geographical range, and the spatial
  scale of analysis. We found multiple evidence of links between drivers and
  services mediated by functional traits, particularly between land- use
  changes and regulating services in vegetation and invertebrates. Seventy-
  five functional traits were recorded in our sample. However, few of these
  functional traits were repeatedly found to be associated with both the
  species responses to direct drivers of change (response traits) and the
  species effects on the provision of ecosystem services (effect traits). Our
  results highlight the existence of potential “key functional traits,”
  understood as those that have the capacity to influence the provision of
  multiple ecosystem services, while responding to specific drivers of change,
  across a variety of systems and organisms. Identifying “key functional
  traits” would help to develop robust indicator systems to monitor changes
  in biodiversity and their effects on ecosystem functioning and ecosystem

    The ecosystem services (ES) framework was developed to articulate and
  measure the benefits humans receive from ecosystems. Cultural ecosystem
  services (CES), usually defined as the intangible and nonmaterial benefits
  ecosystems provide, have been relatively neglected by researchers and
  policy-makers compared to provisioning, supporting, and regulating services.
  Although valuing CES poses several conceptual and methodological
  difficulties, it is of huge interest and importance because of the linkages
  between cultural values, valuation methods, and the individual and collective
  decision-making that influence ecosystems and human wellbeing. This review is
  not a how-to guide, but rather examines key conceptual issues and maps
  critical areas of debate. There is a range of potential approaches to
  assessing CES; however, choices regarding valuation methods and their role in
  decision-making are shaped by cultural and political dynamics. CES are at a
  crossroads. They can potentially act as a fruitful conceptual container for a
  broad range of interdisciplinary research into human-environment relations
  and transform how decisions regarding the environment are made, but they can
  also be used to legitimize and entrench modes of decision-making that
  marginalize and undermine the very values they are intended to protect.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a
  variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species
  extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components
  of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons,
  but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the
  goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments,
  observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties
  depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of
  organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of
  those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the
  effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in
  influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the
  above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The
  scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the
  relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many
  points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require
  integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem
  properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving
  species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and
  management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with
  understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management
  practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to
  minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management
  of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review
  of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions:
  1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem
  properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts,
  including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological
  engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation,
  mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a
  good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even
  relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence
  pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems
  via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered
  ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these
  changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with
  technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in
  composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can
  differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential
  community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to
  species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out
  similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little
  to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by
  abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a
  stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal
  variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and
  larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following
  conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their
  patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and
  nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence
  the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification
  of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex
  communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic
  species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar
  environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species
  richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure,
  disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence
  invasion success and often override effects of species richness in
  comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of
  species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can
  stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation
  in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms
  of different functional effect and functional response types will help
  preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further
  research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the
  relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community
  structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2)
  Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied
  in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem
  properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much
  more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity
  of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced
  experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments
  to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental
  perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of
  disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for
  several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity
  both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the
  feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental
  communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of
  extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global
  change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem
  properties for the development of effective management and conservation
  strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some
  coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and
  theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described
  here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is
  necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances
  under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating
  diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in
  making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing
  those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct,
  such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and
  mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future
  management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to
  communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a
  perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.%

    Evidence is mounting that extinctions are altering key processes important
  to the productivity and sustainability of Earth's ecosystems. Further species
  loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes, but it is unclear how
  these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental
  change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function.
  Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the
  effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition--two processes
  important in all ecosystems--are of comparable magnitude to the effects of
  many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels
  of species loss (21-40%) reduced plant production by 5-10%, comparable to
  previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming.
  Higher levels of extinction (41-60%) had effects rivalling those of ozone,
  acidification, elevated CO(2) and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels,
  species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did
  elevated CO(2) and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a
  large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide
  range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies
  on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our
  analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss
  are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global
  change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and
  remediation efforts.%

    Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are increasingly using big-data
  approaches to tackle questions at large spatial, taxonomic, and temporal

  shortfalls and review the tradeoffs between generality and uncertainty. We
  present seven key shortfalls of current biodiversity data. Four previously
  proposed shortfalls pinpoint knowledge gaps for species taxonomy (Linnean),
  distribution (Wallacean), abundance (Prestonian), and evolutionary patterns
  (Darwinian). We also redefine the Hutchinsonian shortfall to apply to the
  abiotic tolerances of species and propose new shortfalls relating to limited
  knowledge of species traits (Raunkiaeran) and biotic interactions (Eltonian).
  We conclude with a general framework for the combined impacts and

    Recent research has demonstrated how scavenging, the act of consuming dead
  animals, plays a key role in ecosystem structure, functioning, and stability.
  A growing number of studies suggest that vertebrate scavengers also provide
  key ecosystem services, the benefits humans gain from the natural world,
  particularly in the removal of carcasses from the environment. An increasing
  proportion of the human population is now residing in cities and towns, many
  of which, despite being highly altered environments, contain significant
  wildlife populations, and so animal carcasses. Indeed, non-predation
  fatalities may be higher within urban than natural environments. Despite
  this, the fate of carcasses in urban environments and the role vertebrate
  scavengers play in their removal have not been determined. In this study, we
  quantify the role of vertebrate scavengers in urban environments in three
  towns in the UK. Using experimentally deployed rat carcasses and rapid fire
  motion-triggered cameras, we determined which species were scavenging and how
  removal of carcass biomass was partitioned between them. Of the 63
  experimental carcasses deployed, vertebrate scavenger activity was detected
  at 67%. There was a significantly greater depletion in carcass biomass in the
  presence (mean loss of 194 g) than absence (mean loss of 14 g) of
  scavengers. Scavenger activity was restricted to three species, Carrion crows
  Corvus corone, Eurasian magpies Pica pica, and European red foxes Vulpes
  vulpes. From behavioral analysis, we estimated that a maximum of 73% of the
  carcass biomass was removed by vertebrate scavengers. Despite having low
  species richness, the urban scavenger community in our urban study system
  removed a similar proportion of carcasses to those reported in more pristine
  environments. Vertebrate scavengers are providing a key urban ecosystem
  service in terms of carcass removal. This service is, however, often
  overlooked, and the species that provide it are among some of the most
  disliked and persecuted.%

    Species numbers are increasing rapidly. This is due mostly to taxonomic
  inflation, where known subspecies are raised to species as a result in a
  change in species concept, rather than to new discoveries. Yet
  macroecologists and conservation biologists depend heavily on species lists,
  treating them as accurate and stable measures of biodiversity. Deciding on a
  standardized, universal species list might ameliorate the mismatch between
  taxonomy and the uses to which it is put. However, taxonomic uncertainty is

    Biodiversity loss decreases ecosystem functioning at the local scales at
  which species interact, but it remains unclear how biodiversity loss affects
  ecosystem functioning at the larger scales of space and time that are most
  relevant to biodiversity conservation and policy. Theory predicts that
  addi-tional insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning could
  emerge across time and space if species respond asynchronously to
  environmental variation and if species become increas-ingly dominant when and
  where they are most productive. Even if only a few dominant species maintain
  ecosystem functioning within a particular time and place, ecosystem
  functioning may be enhanced by many different species across many times and
  places (b-diversity). Here, we develop and apply a new approach to estimate
  these previously unquantified insurance effects of biodiver-sity on ecosystem
  functioning that arise due to species turnover across times and places. In a
  long-term (18-year) grassland plant diversity experiment, we find that total
  insurance effects are positive in sign and substantial in magnitude,
  amounting to 19% of the net biodiversity effect, mostly due to temporal
  insurance effects. Species loss can therefore reduce ecosystem functioning
  both locally and by eliminating species that would otherwise enhance
  ecosystem functioning across temporally fluctuating and spatially
  heterogeneous environments.%

    Aim: To understand how climatic conditions influence the geographical
  distributions of species and their potential responses to climate change, we
  investigated the relationships between the thermal tolerances of species and
  the size and limits of their distributions. We tested two hypotheses for
  endotherms: the climatic variability hypothesis, which predicts increases in
  range size with increasing breadth of thermal tolerance, and the climatic
  extreme hypothesis, which predicts that range limits are related to thermal
  tolerance limits. Furthermore, we tested whether these relationships differ
  between temperate and tropical areas. Location: Global. Time period: Present.
  Major taxa studied: Birds and mammals. Methods: We compiled data on thermal
  tolerances that had been measured in physiological experiments for 453
  endothermic species, along with information on geographical ranges and
  climatic conditions. We applied phylogenetic generalized least square
  regressions to test for relationships between thermal tolerance and (a) range
  size or limits and (b) breadth and extremes of the climatic conditions that
  each species experiences across its distribution. Results: We found that
  range size was not related to the breadth thermal tolerance for endotherms.
  However, the range limits at high latitudes as well as the minimum
  temperatures experienced by species were closely related to the physiological
  cold tolerances of species. These relationships were particularly strong in
  temperate regions, but these patterns were not found in the tropics. Main
  conclusions: Our results are inconsistent with the predictions of the
  climatic variability hypothesis, but are in line with the predictions of the
  climatic extreme hypothesis. Furthermore, the factors determining species
  distributions do not appear to be the same in tropical and temperate regions.
  Our study emphasizes the need to combine spatially explicit distribution
  models with information from physiological experiments in order to capture
  regional differences and improve predictions of the responses of species to
  climate change.%

    Ecological trait data are essential for understanding the broad-scale
  distribution of biodiversity and its response to global change. For animals,
  diet represents a fundamental aspect of species' evolutionary adaptations,
  ecological and functional roles, and trophic interactions. However, the
  importance of diet for macroevolutionary and macroecological dynamics remains
  little explored, partly because of the lack of comprehensive trait datasets.
  We compiled and evaluated a comprehensive global dataset of diet preferences
  of mammals ("MammalDIET"). Diet information was digitized from two global and
  cladewide data sources and errors of data entry by multiple data recorders
  were assessed. We then developed a hierarchical extrapolation procedure to
  fill-in diet information for species with missing information. Missing data
  were extrapolated with information from other taxonomic levels (genus, other
  species within the same genus, or family) and this extrapolation was
  subsequently validated both internally (with a jack-knife approach applied to
  the compiled species-level diet data) and externally (using independent
  species-level diet information from a comprehensive continentwide data
  source). Finally, we grouped mammal species into trophic levels and dietary
  guilds, and their species richness as well as their proportion of total
  richness were mapped at a global scale for those diet categories with good
  validation results. The success rate of correctly digitizing data was 94%,
  indicating that the consistency in data entry among multiple recorders was
  high. Data sources provided species-level diet information for a total of
  2033 species (38% of all 5364 terrestrial mammal species, based on the IUCN
  taxonomy). For the remaining 3331 species, diet information was mostly
  extrapolated from genus-level diet information (48% of all terrestrial mammal
  species), and only rarely from other species within the same genus (6%) or
  from family level (8%). Internal and external validation showed that: (1)
  extrapolations were most reliable for primary food items; (2) several diet
  categories ("Animal", "Mammal", "Invertebrate", "Plant", "Seed", "Fruit", and
  "Leaf") had high proportions of correctly predicted diet ranks; and (3) the
  potential of correctly extrapolating specific diet categories varied both
  within and among clades. Global maps of species richness and proportion
  showed congruence among trophic levels, but also substantial discrepancies
  between dietary guilds. MammalDIET provides a comprehensive, unique and
  freely available dataset on diet preferences for all terrestrial mammals
  worldwide. It enables broad-scale analyses for specific trophic levels and
  dietary guilds, and a first assessment of trait conservatism in mammalian
  diet preferences at a global scale. The digitalization, extrapolation and
  validation procedures could be transferable to other trait data and taxa.%

    The use of functional traits to describe community structure is a promising
  approach to reveal generalities across organisms and ecosystems. Plant
  ecologists have demonstrated the importance of traits in explaining community
  structure, competitive interactions as well as ecosystem functioning. The
  application of trait-based methods to more complex communities such as food
  webs is however more challenging owing to the diversity of animal
  characteristics and of interactions. The objective of this study was to
  determine how functional structure is related to food web structure. We
  consider that food web structure is the result of 1) the match between
  consumer and resource traits, which determine the occurence of a trophic
  interaction between them, and 2) the distribution of functional traits in the
  community. We implemented a statistical approach to assess whether or not 35
  466 pairwise interactions between soil organisms are constrained by
  trait-matching and then used a Procrustes analysis to investigate
  correlations between functional indices and network properties across 48
  sites. We found that the occurrence of trophic interactions is well predicted
  by matching the traits of the resource with those of the consumer. Taxonomy
  and body mass of both species were the most important traits for the
  determination of an interaction. As a consequence, functional evenness and
  the variance of certain traits in the community were correlated to trophic
  complementarity between species, while trait identity, more than diversity,
  was related to network topology. The analysis was however limited by trait
  data availability, and a coarse resolution of certain taxonomic groups in our
  dataset. These limitations explain the importance of taxonomy, as well as the
  complexity of the statistical model needed. Our results outline the important
  implications of trait composition on ecological networks, opening promising
  avenues of research into the relationship between functional diversity and
  ecosystem functioning in multi-trophic systems. This article is protected by

    1. The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be
  grouped accord- ing to common responses to the environment and/or common
  effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships
  between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental
  factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that
  determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as
  biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2.
  We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology,
  ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem
  func- tioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental
  filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with
  appropriate responses, result in assem- blages with varying trait
  composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which
  relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by
  different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily
  deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3. To illustrate this framework we
  analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While
  traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped
  with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was
  found between response to fire and flammability. 4. We hypothesize that these
  patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be
  determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling,
  because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between
  acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic
  traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have
  little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be
  of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5. This framework is likely to be
  broadly applicable, although caution must be exer- cised to use trait
  linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental con- ditions
  and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional
  types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of
  experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem
  properties.%

    Top-order predators often have positive effects on biological diversity
  owing to their key functional roles in regulating trophic cascades and other
  ecological processes. Their loss has been identified as a major factor
  contributing to the decline of biodiversity in both aquatic and terrestrial
  systems. Consequently, restoring and maintaining the ecological function of
  top predators is a critical global imperative. Here we review studies of the
  ecological effects of the dingo Canis lupus dingo, Australia's largest land
  predator, using this as a case study to explore the influence of a top
  predator on biodiversity at a continental scale. The dingo was introduced to
  Australia by people at least 3500 years ago and has an ambiguous status owing
  to its brief history on the continent, its adverse impacts on livestock
  production and its role as an ecosystem architect. A large body of research
  now indicates that dingoes regulate ecological cascades, particularly in arid
  Australia, and that the removal of dingoes results in an increase in the
  abundances and impacts of herbivores and invasive mesopredators, most notably
  the red fox Vulpes vulpes. The loss of dingoes has been linked to widespread
  losses of small and medium-sized native mammals, the depletion of plant
  biomass due to the effects of irrupting herbivore populations and increased
  predation rates by red foxes. We outline a suite of conceptual models to
  describe the effects of dingoes on vertebrate populations across different
  Australian environments. Finally, we discuss key issues that require
  consideration or warrant research before the ecological effects of dingoes
  can be incorporated formally into biodiversity conservation programs.%

    The theory of "top-down" ecological regulation predicts that herbivory
  suppresses plant abundance, biomass, and survival but increases diversity
  through the disproportionate consumption of dominant species, which inhibits
  competitive exclusion. To date, these outcomes have been clear in aquatic
  ecosystems but not on land. We explicate this discrepancy using a
  meta-analysis of experimental results from 123 native animal exclusions in
  natural terrestrial ecosystems (623 pairwise comparisons). Consistent with
  top-down predictions, we found that herbivores significantly reduced plant
  abundance, biomass, survival, and reproduction (all P < 0.01) and increased
  species evenness but not richness (P = 0.06 and P = 0.59, respectively).
  However, when examining patterns in the strength of top-down effects, with
  few exceptions, we were unable to detect significantly different effect sizes
  among biomes, based on local site characteristics (climate or productivity)
  or study characteristics (study duration or exclosure size). The positive
  effects on diversity were only significant in studies excluding large animals
  or located in temperate grasslands. The results demonstrate that top-down
  regulation by herbivores is a pervasive process shaping terrestrial plant
  communities at the global scale, but its strength is highly site specific and
  not predicted by basic site conditions. We suggest that including herbivore
  densities as a covariate in future exclosure studies will facilitate the
  discovery of unresolved macroecology trends in the strength of
  herbivore-plant interactions.%

    1. Examining the consequences of environmental change for the provision of
  ecosystem services can be facilitated through trait-based frameworks that
  consider linkages between traits that influence a species' response to change
  and traits that determine its effect on ecosystem services. 2. Developing
  these frameworks requires a systematic approach to trait selection and
  addressing the interrelationships among the scale of the environmental
  change, area of ecosystem service provision and the most appropriate traits
  for analysis. 3. We examine key issues in the application of trait approaches
  to vertebrates, drawing specifically on the substantial progress made in this
  area for plants. We argue that vertebrate ecologists need to develop more
  coherent and systematic trait-based approaches that are broadly applicable.
  4. We present a new framework for selecting response and effect traits to
  link environmental change with ecosystem services. An empirical example of
  each step in the framework is provided using birds as a case study, linking
  the environmental change of loss of tree cover with the ecosystem service of
  invertebrate pest regulation in apple orchards. We found that as tree cover
  around orchards increased so did the abundance and foraging rate of bird
  species that pursue invertebrates in flight, and this may help reduce the
  abundance of certain pests of apples (e.g. adult stages of Cydia pomonella
  and Helicoverpa armigera). 5. Implementing a systematic and transparent
  approach to trait selection should further refine the development of
  trait-based approaches for vertebrates.%

    A growing understanding of the ecology of seed dispersal has so far had
  little influence on conservation practice, while the needs of conservation
  practice have had little influence on seed dispersal research. Yet seed
  dispersal interacts decisively with the major drivers of biodiversity change
  in the 21st century: habitat fragmentation, overharvesting, biological
  invasions, and climate change. We synthesize current knowledge of the effects
  these drivers have on seed dispersal to identify research gaps and to show
  how this information can be used to improve conservation management. The
  drivers, either individually, or in combination, have changed the quantity,
  species composition, and spatial pattern of dispersed seeds in the majority
  of ecosystems worldwide, with inevitable consequences for species survival in
  a rapidly changing world. The natural history of seed dispersal is now
  well-understood in a range of landscapes worldwide. Only a few
  generalizations that have emerged are directly applicable to conservation
  management, however, because they are frequently confounded by site-specific
  and species-specific variation. Potentially synergistic interactions between
  disturbances are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts, but these are
  rarely investigated. We recommend that the conservation status of
  functionally unique dispersers be revised and that the conservation target
  for key seed dispersers should be a population size that maintains their
  ecological function, rather than merely the minimum viable population. Based
  on our analysis of conservation needs, seed dispersal research should be
  carried out at larger spatial scales in heterogenous landscapes, examining
  the simultaneous impacts of multiple drivers on community-wide seed dispersal
  networks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.%

    There is considerable debate about whether community ecology will ever
  produce general principles. We suggest here that this can be achieved but
  that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species

  should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a
  two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits
  within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the
  interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized

    The capacity of species to track shifting climates into the future will
  strongly influence outcomes for biodiversity under a rapidly changing
  climate. However, we know remarkably little about the dispersal abilities of
  most species and how these may be influenced by climate change. Here we show
  that climate change is projected to substantially reduce the seed dispersal
  services provided by frugivorous vertebrates in rainforests across the
  Australian Wet Tropics. Our model projections show reductions in both median
  and long-distance seed dispersal, which may markedly reduce the capacity of
  many rainforest plant species to track shifts in suitable habitat under
  climate change. However, our analyses suggest that active management to
  maintain the abundances of a small set of important frugivores under climate
  change could markedly reduce the projected loss of seed dispersal services
  and facilitate shifting distributions of rainforest plant species.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Phylogenetic imputation has recently emerged as a potentially powerful tool
  for predicting missing data in functional traits datasets. As such,
  understanding the limitations of phylogenetic modelling in predicting trait
  values is critical if we are to use them in subsequent analyses. Previous
  studies have focused on the relationship between phylogenetic signal and
  clade-level prediction accuracy, yet variability in prediction accuracy among
  individual tips of phylogenies remains largely unexplored. Here, we used
  simulations of trait evolution along the branches of phylogenetic trees to
  show how the accuracy of phylogenetic imputations is influenced by the
  combined effects of (1) the amount of phylogenetic signal in the traits and
  (2) the branch length of the tips to be imputed. Specifically, we conducted
  cross-validation trials to estimate the variability in prediction accuracy
  among individual tips on the phylogenies (hereafter “tip-level
  accuracy”). We found that under a Brownian motion model of evolution (BM,
  Pagel's $\lambda$ = 1), tip-level accuracy rapidly decreased with increasing
  tip branch-lengths, and only tips of approximately 10% or less of the total
  height of the trees showed consistently accurate predictions (i.e.
  cross-validation R-squared > 0.75). When phylogenetic signal was weak, the
  effect of tip branch-length was reduced, becoming negligible for traits
  simulated with $\lambda$ < 0.7, where accuracy was in any case low. Our study
  shows that variability in prediction accuracy among individual tips of the
  phylogeny should be considered when evaluating the reliability of
  phylogenetically imputed trait values. To address this challenge, we describe
  a Monte Carlo-based method that allows one to estimate the expected tip-level
  accuracy of phylogenetic predictions for continuous traits. Our approach
  identifies gaps in functional trait datasets for which phylogenetic
  imputation performs poorly, and will help ecologists to design more efficient
  trait collection campaigns by focusing resources on lineages whose trait
  values are more uncertain. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

    1.Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each
  other more than species drawn at random from the same tree. This pattern is
  of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research
  areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it.
  Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and
  guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2.Here, we
  compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data.
  Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along
  phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated
  the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution
  of tree structure and the availability of branch length information,
  examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the
  associated statistical tests. 3.We found that under a Brownian motion (BM)
  model of trait evolution, Abouheif's Cmean and Pagel's $\lambda$ performed
  well and substantially better than Moran's I and Blomberg's K. Pagel's
  $\lambda$ provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for
  discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was
  computationally more demanding than Abouheif's Cmean. Blomberg's K was most
  suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation
  experiments. 4.Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty
  but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing
  branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5.We propose
  guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to
  true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a
  quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different
  topologies of phylogenies. 6.These guidelines aim to better assess
  phylogenetic signal and distinguish it from random trait distributions. They
  were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with
  more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree
  generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when
  requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that
  explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific
  clades.%

    Studying life-history traits within and across taxonomic classifications

    COMMUNITIES of species and their associated biological, chemical and
  physical processes, collectively known as ecosystems, drive the Earth's
  biogeochemical processes(1,2). Currently most ecosystems are experiencing
  loss of biodiversity associated with the activities of human expansion(3-5),
  raising the issue of whether the biogeochemical functioning of ecosystems
  will be impaired by this loss of species(6-8). Current ecological knowledge
  supports a wide range of views on the subject(9-13), but empirical tests are
  few(9,14-16). Here we provide evidence from direct experimental manipulation
  of diversity by over an order of magnitude, using multi-trophic level
  communities and simultaneous measures of several ecosystem processes, that
  reduced biodiversity may indeed alter the performance of ecosystems.%

    The most common approach to dealing with missing data is to delete cases
  containing missing observations. However, this approach reduces statistical
  power and increases estimation bias. A recent study shows how estimates of

  (missing data due to mortality) is ignored, thus demonstrating the dangers of
  neglecting missing data in ecology and evolution. We highlight recent

    Aim Islands are thought to promote correlated ecological and life-history
  shifts in species, including increased population density, and an infrequent
  production of few, large, offspring. These patterns are collectively termed
  ‘the island syndrome'. We present here the first, phylogenetically
  informed, global test of the ‘island syndrome' hypothesis, using lizards as
  our model organisms. Location World-wide. Methods We assembled a database
  containing 641 lizard species, their phylogenetic relationships, geographic
  ranges and the following life-history traits: female mass, clutch size, brood
  frequency, hatchling body mass and population density. We tested for
  life-history differences between insular and mainland forms in light of the
  island syndrome, controlling for mass and latitude, and for phylogenetic
  non-independence. We also examined the effects of population density and, in
  insular endemics, of island area, on lizard reproductive traits. Results We
  found that insular endemic lizards lay smaller clutches of larger hatchlings
  than closely related mainland lizards of similar size, as was expected by the
  island syndrome. In general, however, insular endemics lay more frequently
  than mainland ones. Species endemic to small islands lay as frequently as
  mainland species. Continental and insular lizards have similar productivity
  rates overall. Island area had little effect on lizard reproductive traits.
  No trait showed association with population density. Main conclusions Island
  endemic lizards mainly follow the island syndrome. We hypothesize that large
  offspring are favoured on islands because of increased intra-specific
  aggression and cannibalism by adults. Stable populations on islands lacking
  predators may likewise lead to increased intra-specific competition, and
  hence select for larger hatchlings that will quickly grow to adult size. This
  view is supported by the fact that lizard populations are denser on islands
  – although population density per se was uncorrelated with any of the
  traits we examined%

    Aim The species population density–range size relationship posits that
  locally abundant species are widely distributed. However, this proposed
  pattern has been insufficiently tested. The few tests conducted were usually
  limited in scale and gave conflicting results. We tested the generality of
  the positive population density–range size relationship. We then studied
  whether similar environmental niche requirements are correlated with range
  size and with population density to search for mechanisms driving the
  hypothesized link between population density and range size. Location
  Worldwide. Methods We collected data on population density, range size and
  environmental niche for a global dataset of 192 lizard, 893 bird and 350
  mammal species. Assessing the relationship between population density and
  range size and environmental niche parameters, we corrected for phylogenetic
  relationships, body mass, diet and study area. Results Our findings reveal
  that density had a weak negative correlation with bird range size and was
  unrelated to lizard and mammal range size. These trends were consistent at
  the global scale and across the biogeographical realms. Range size was
  related to relatively similar environmental niche parameters in all groups.
  Population density, however, was explained by taxon-specific factors and was
  therefore unrelated to range size by common causation. Main conclusions We
  suggest that the positive relationship between population density and range
  size identified in previous studies might be an artefact arising through
  incomplete sampling of range sizes. Our results indicate that the mechanisms
  shaping population density and range size may be independent.%

    Current ecological and evolutionary research are increasingly moving from
  species- to trait-based approaches because traits provide a stronger link to
  organism's function and fitness. Trait databases covering a large number of
  species are becoming available, but such data remains scarce for certain
  groups. Amphibians are among the most diverse vertebrate groups on Earth, and
  constitute an abundant component of major terrestrial and freshwater
  ecosystems. They are also facing rapid population declines worldwide, which
  is likely to affect trait composition in local communities, thereby impacting
  ecosystem processes and services. In this context, we introduce AmphiBIO, a
  comprehensive database of natural history traits for amphibians worldwide.
  The database releases information on 17 traits related to ecology, morphology
  and reproduction features of amphibians. We compiled data from more than
  1,500 literature sources, and for more than 6,500 species of all orders
  (Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona), 61 families and 531 genera. This database
  has the potential to allow unprecedented large-scale analyses in ecology,
  evolution, and conservation of amphibians.%

    Generation length (GL) is defined as the average age of parents of the
  current cohort, reflecting the turnover rate of breeding individuals in a
  population. GL is a fundamental piece of information for population ecology
  as well as for measuring species threat status (e.g. in the IUCN Red List).
  Here we present a dataset including GL records for all extant mammal species
  (n=5427). We first reviewed all data on GL published in the IUCN Red List
  database. We then calculated a value for species with available reproductive
  parameters (reproductive life span and age at first reproduction). We
  assigned to missing-data species a mean GL value from congeneric or
  confamilial species (depending on data availability). Finally, for a few
  remaining species, we assigned mean GL values from species with similar body
  mass and belonging to the same order. Our work provides the first attempt to
  complete a database of GL for mammals; it will be an essential reference
  point for all conservation-related studies that need pragmatic information on
  species GL, such as population dynamics and applications of the IUCN Red List
  assessment.%

    The recruitment of seedlings from seeds is the key demographic transition
  for rain forest trees. Though tropical forest mammals are known to consume
  many seeds, their effects on tree community structure remain little known. To
  evaluate their effects, we monitored 8,000 seeds of 24 tree species using
  exclosure cages that were selectively permeable to three size classes of
  mammals for up to 4.4 years. Small and medium- bodied mammals removed many
  more seeds than did large mammals, and they alone generated beta diversity
  and negative density dependence, whereas all mammals reduced diversity and
  shaped local species composition. Thus, small and medium- bodied mammals more
  strongly contributed to community structure and promoted species coexistence
  than did large mammals. Given that seedling recruitment is seed limited for
  most species, alterations to the composition of the community of mammalian
  seed predators is expected to have long- term consequences for tree community
  structure in tropical forests.%

    In a recent paper, McLachlan et al. presented evidence that migration rates
  of two tree species at the end of the last glacial (c. 10-20 thousand years
  ago) were much slower than was previously thought. These results provide an
  important insight for climate-change impacts studies and suggest that the
  ability of species to track future climate change is limited. However, the
  detection of late-glacial refugia close to modern range limits also implies
  that some of our most catastrophic projections might be overstated.

    * Despite efforts in data collection, missing values are commonplace in
  life-history trait databases. Because these values typically are not missing
  randomly, the common practice of removing missing data not only reduces
  sample size, but also introduces bias that can lead to incorrect conclusions.
  Imputing missing values is a potential solution to this problem. Here, we
  evaluate the performance of four approaches for estimating missing values in
  trait databases (K-nearest neighbour (kNN), multivariate imputation by
  chained equations (mice), missForest and Phylopars), and test whether imputed
  datasets retain underlying allometric relationships among traits.\n\n*
  Starting with a nearly complete trait dataset on the mammalian order
  Carnivora (using four traits), we artificially removed values so that the
  percent of missing values ranged from 10% to 80%. Using the original values
  as a reference, we assessed imputation performance using normalized root mean
  squared error. We also evaluated whether including phylogenetic information
  improved imputation performance in kNN, mice, and missForest (it is a
  required input in Phylopars). Finally, we evaluated the extent to which the
  allometric relationship between two traits (body mass and longevity) was
  conserved for imputed datasets by looking at the difference (bias) between
  the slope of the original and the imputed datasets or datasets with missing
  values removed.\n\n* Three of the tested approaches (mice, missForest and
  Phylopars), resulted in qualitatively equivalent imputation performance, and
  all had significantly lower errors than kNN. Adding phylogenetic information
  into the imputation algorithms improved estimation of missing values for all
  tested traits. The allometric relationship between body mass and longevity
  was conserved when up to 60% of data were missing, either with or without
  phylogenetic information, depending on the approach. This relationship was
  less biased in imputed datasets compared to datasets with missing values
  removed, especially when more than 30% of values were missing.\n\n*
  Imputations provide valuable alternatives to removing missing observations in
  trait databases as they produce low errors and retain relationships among
  traits. Although we must continue to prioritize data collection on species
  traits, imputations can provide a valuable solution for conducting
  macroecological and evolutionary studies using life-history trait databases.%

    Vertebrate pollinators are increasingly threatened worldwide, but little is
  known about the potential consequences of declining pollinator populations on
  plants and ecosystems. Here, we present the first global assessment of the
  importance of vertebrate pollinators in the reproductive success of selected
  flowering plants. Our meta-analysis of 126 experiments on animal-pollinated
  plants revealed that excluding vertebrate pollinators – but not insect
  pollinators – reduced fruit and/or seed production by 63% on average. We
  found bat-pollinated plants to be more dependent on their respective
  vertebrate pollinators than bird-pollinated plants (an average 83% reduction
  in fruit/seed production when bats were excluded, as compared to a 46%
  reduction when birds were excluded). Plant dependence on vertebrate
  pollinators for fruit/seed production was greater in the tropics than at
  higher latitudes. Given the potential for substantial negative impacts
  associated with the loss of vertebrate pollinators, there is a clear need for
  prompt, effective conservation action for threatened flower-visiting
  vertebrate species. Additional research on how such changes might affect
  wider ecosystems is also required.%

    Package contains various functions for phylogenetic analysis. This
  functionality is concentrated in the phylogenetic analysis of comparative
  data from species. For example, the package includes functions for Bayesian
  and ML ancestral state estimation; visual simulation of trait evolution;
  fitting models of trait evolution with multiple Brownian rates and
  correlations; visualizing discrete and continuous character evolution using
  colors or projections into trait space; identifying the location of a change
  in the rate of character evolution on the tree; fast Brownian motion
  simulation and simulation under several other models of continuous trait
  evolution; fitting a model of correlated binary trait evolution; locating the
  position of a fossil or an recently extinct lineage on a tree using
  continuous character data with ML; plotting lineage accumulation through
  time, including across multiple trees (such as a Bayesian posterior sample);
  conducting an analysis called stochastic character mapping, in which
  character histories for a discrete trait are sampled from their posterior
  probability distribution under a model; conducting a multiple (i.e., partial)
  Mantel test; fitting a phylogenetic regression model with error in predictor
  and response variables; conducting a phylogenetic principal components
  analysis, a phylogenetic regression, a reduced major axis regression, a
  phylogenetic canonical correlation analysis, and a phylogenetic ANOVA;
  projecting a tree onto a geographic map; simulating discrete character
  histories on the tree; and fitting a model in which a discrete character
  evolves under the threshold model. In addition to this phylogenetic
  comparative method functionality, the package also contains functions for a
  wide range of other purposes in phylogenetic biology. For instance,
  functionality in this package includes (but is not restricted to): adding
  taxa to a tree (including randomly, everywhere, or automatically to genera);
  generating all bi- and multi-furcating trees for a set of taxa; reducing a
  phylogeny to its backbone tree; dropping tips or adding tips to special types
  of phylogenetic trees; exporting a tree as an XML file; converting a tree
  with a mapped character to a tree with singleton nodes and one character
  state per edge; estimating a phylogeny using the least squares method;
  simulating birth-death trees under a range of conditions; rerooting trees; a
  wide range of visualizations of trees; and a variety of other manipulations
  and analyses that phylogenetic biologists may find useful for their
  research.%

    Quantifying the relative impacts of top-down vs. bottom-up control of
  ecosystems remains a controversial issue, with debate often focusing on the
  perennial question of how predators affect prey densities. To assess predator
  impacts, we performed a worldwide meta-analysis of field experiments in which
  the densities of terrestrial vertebrate predators were manipulated and the
  responses of their terrestrial vertebrate prey were measured. Our results
  show that predation indeed limits prey populations, as prey densities change
  substantially after predator manipulations. The main determinant of the
  result of an experiment was the efficiency of predator manipulation. Positive
  impacts of predator manipulation appeared to increase with duration of the
  experiment for non-cyclic prey, while the opposite was true for cyclic prey.
  In addition, predator manipulation showed a large positive impact on cyclic
  prey at low prey densities, but had no obvious impact at peak prey densities.
  As prey population densities generally respond predictably to predator
  manipula- tions, we suggest that control of introduced vertebrate predators
  can be used to effectively conserve and manage native wildlife. However, care
  should be taken when controlling native predators, especially apex species,
  owing to their importance as strong interactors and the biodiversity value of
  their habitats. We discuss gaps in our knowledge of predator–prey
  relationships and methodological issues related to manipulation experiments.
  An important guideline for future studies is that adequate monitoring of
  predator numbers before and during the experiment is the only way to ensure
  that observed responses in prey populations are actually caused by changes in
  predation impacts.%

  core attrib- utes of fitness (reproduction and survival), yet large-scale
  comparative studies quantifying its implications for the ecology and life
  history of ectotherms are scarce. We tested the allometry of longevity in
  squamates and the tuatara, and determined how longevity is related to key
  environmental characteristics and life- history traits. Predictions based on
  life-history theory are expected to hold true for ectotherms, similarly to
  mammals and birds. Location World-wide. Methods We assembled fromthe
  literature a dataset of the maximum longevities of more than a thousand
  squamate species, representing c. 10% of their known species diversity, their
  phylogenetic relationships and multiple life-history and ecological
  variables. Correcting for phylogeny, we modelled the link between squamate
  longevity and both key life-history traits, such as body mass and age at
  first reproduction, and important environmental factors, such as latitude and
  primary productivity within species distributional ranges. Results
  Large-bodied species live for longer than small ones, but body size explains
  far less of the variance in longevity than it does in mammals and birds.
  Accounting for body size, squamate brood frequency is negatively correlated
  with longevity, while age at first reproduction is positively correlatedwith
  longevity. This points to a continuum of slow-to-fast life-history
  strategies. Squamates in high latitudes and cold regions live for longer,
  probably because a shorter season of activity translates to slower
  development, older age at first reproduction and hence to increased
  longevity. Individuals live longer in captivity than in the wild. Her-
  bivorous and omnivorous squamates live for longer than carnivorous ones. We
  postulate that low-quality nutrition reduces growth rates, promotes a
  relative decline in reproductive rates and thus prolongs life. Main
  conclusions Our results support key predictions from life-history theory and
  suggest that reproducing more slowly and at older ages, being herbivorous
  and, plausibly, lowering metabolism, result in increased longevity.%

    Knowledge of mammalian diversity is still surprisingly disparate, both
  regionally and taxonomically. Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of
  the conservation status and distribution of the world's mammals. Data,
  compiled by 1700+ experts, cover all 5487 species, including marine mammals.
  Global macroecological patterns are very different for land and marine
  species but suggest common mechanisms driving diversity and endemism across
  systems. Compared with land species, threat levels are higher among marine
  mammals, driven by different processes (accidental mortality and pollution,
  rather than habitat loss), and are spatially distinct (peaking in northern
  oceans, rather than in Southeast Asia). Marine mammals are also
  disproportionately poorly known. These data are made freely available to
  support further scientific developments and conservation action.%

    As they have in response to past climatic changes, many species will shift
  their distributions in response to modern climate change. However, due to the
  unprecedented rapidity of projected climatic changes, some species may not be
  able to move their ranges fast enough to track shifts in suitable climates
  and associated habitats. Here, we investigate the ability of 493 mammals to
  keep pace with projected climatic changes in the Western Hemisphere. We
  modeled the velocities at which species will likely need to move to keep pace
  with projected changes in suitable climates. We compared these velocities
  with the velocities at which species are able to move as a function of
  dispersal distances and dispersal frequencies. Across the Western Hemisphere,
  on average, 9.2% of mammals at a given location will likely be unable to keep
  pace with climate change. In some places, up to 39% of mammals may be unable
  to track shifts in suitable climates. Eighty-seven percent of mammalian
  species are expected to experience reductions in range size and 20% of these
  range reductions will likely be due to limited dispersal abilities as opposed
  to reductions in the area of suitable climate. Because climate change will
  likely outpace the response capacity of many mammals, mammalian vulnerability
  to climate change may be more extensive than previously anticipated.%

    Aim: Both theory and empirical data suggest that life histories of insular
  species slow down (the " island syndrome "). Insular individuals are
  hypothesized to lay smaller clutches of larger eggs compared with individuals
  belonging to closely related main-land species. Most lizards have variable
  clutch sizes and can lay any number between one egg and a species-specific
  maximum which can be well over 50 eggs. Many lizards, such as geckos and
  anoles, however, lay invariant small clutches of one or two eggs, and may
  thus be unable to manifest some aspects of the island syndrome. We tested
  whether insular species with either variable or invariant clutch sizes
  respond to insu-larity differently. Location: Worldwide. Methods: We
  assembled data on egg, clutch, hatchling and female sizes and brood
  frequencies of 2,511 lizard species. We tested whether the predictions of the
  island syndrome were met for lizards laying invariant versus variable
  clutches, controlling for female size and phylogenetic non-independence. We
  further examined whether geckos and anoles, the major clades with invariant
  clutches, differ from other lizards in the way they respond to insularity.
  Results: On islands, species with variable clutch sizes lay smaller clutches
  of larger eggs, from which larger hatchlings emerge, compared with mainland
  species. Lizards with invariant clutch sizes, however, decrease clutch size
  and increase clutch frequency but not hatchling or egg size, compared with
  mainland species. Main conclusions: Lizards with invariant clutch sizes may
  be unable to increase egg and hatchling sizes because of limitations set by
  the female body cavity and pelvic opening, or by arboreality. They
  nonetheless lay smaller clutches on islands and increase clutch frequency. We
  suggest that this may result from lower seasonality of tropical islands,
  leading to a greater spread of reproductive effort. Alternatively, the higher
  clutch frequency on tropical islands could result from fluctuations in
  pop-ulation densities caused by tropical storms.%

    Aim A major Late Quaternary vertebrate extinction event affected mostly
  large-bodied ‘megafauna'. This is well documented in both mammals and
  birds, but evidence of a similar trend in reptiles is scant. We assess the
  relationship between body size and Late Quaternary extinction in reptiles at
  the global level. Location Global. Methods We compile a body size database
  for all 82 reptile species that are known to have gone extinct during the
  last 50,000 years and compare them with the sizes of 10,090 extant reptile
  species (97% of known extant diversity). We assess the body size
  distributions in the major reptile groups: crocodiles, lizards, snakes and
  turtles, while testing and correcting for a size bias in the fossil record.
  We examine geographical biases in extinction by contrasting mainland and
  insular reptile assemblages, and testing for biases within regions and then
  globally by using geographically weighted models. Results Extinct reptiles
  were larger than extant ones, but there was considerable variation in
  extinction size biases among groups. Extinct lizards and turtles were large,
  extinct crocodiles were small and there was no trend in snakes. Lizard
  lineages vary in the way their extinction is related to size. Extinctions
  were particularly prevalent on islands, with 73 of the 82 extinct species
  being island endemics. Four others occurred in Australia. The fossil record
  is biased towards large-bodied reptiles, but extinct lizards were larger than
  extant ones even after we account for this. Main conclusions Body size played
  a complex role in the extinction of Late Quaternary reptiles. Larger lizard
  and turtle species were clearly more affected by extinction mechanisms such
  as over exploitation and invasive species, resulting in a prevalence of
  large-bodied species among extinct taxa. Insularity was by far the strongest
  correlate of recent reptile extinctions, suggesting that size-biased
  extinction mechanisms are amplified in insular environments.%

    Animal populations have undergone substantial declines in recent decades.
  These declines have occurred alongside rapid, human‐driven environmental
  change, including climate warming. An association between population declines
  and environmental change is well established, yet there has been relatively
  little analysis of the importance of the rates of climate warming and its
  interaction with conversion to anthropogenic land use in causing population
  declines. Here we present a global assessment of the impact of rapid climate
  warming and anthropogenic land use conversion on 987 populations of 481
  species of terrestrial birds and mammals since 1950. We collated spatially
  referenced population trends of at least 5 years' duration from the Living
  Planet database and used mixed effects models to assess the association of
  these trends with observed rates of climate warming, rates of conversion to
  anthropogenic land use, body mass, and protected area coverage. We found that
  declines in population abundance for both birds and mammals are greater in
  areas where mean temperature has increased more rapidly, and that this effect
  is more pronounced for birds. However, we do not find a strong effect of
  conversion to anthropogenic land use, body mass, or protected area coverage.
  Our results identify a link between rapid warming and population declines,
  thus supporting the notion that rapid climate warming is a global threat to
  biodiversity.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Animal lifespan is determined by extrinsic and intrinsic factors causing
  mortality. According to the evolutionary theories of senescence, when
  mortality pressures are low, animals delay reproduction. This enables species
  to grow more slowly and, consequently, natural selection can act against
  harmful mutations in adulthood, thereby increasing lifespans. To test
  predictions of these theories we assembled a dataset on the maximum
  longevities and relevant ecological variables of 1320 reptilian species.
  Correcting for phylogeny, we modelled the link between reptile longevity and
  factors such as body size, microhabitat, activity period, insularity, annual
  temperature, temperature seasonality, elevation and clutch size that we
  hypothesized will affect extrinsic mortality rates and hence lifespan. Body
  mass explained a small proportion of the variance in reptile longevity.
  Species living on islands, and in colder and more seasonal environments,
  lived longer. Observed maximum longevity was positively associated with the
  number of individuals used to estimate it. Our results suggest that species
  exposed to reduced extrinsic and intrinsic mortality pressures (lower
  predation, lower metabolic rates and shorter activity periods) live longer.
  Sampling more individuals increases the chances of finding older specimens
  and should be corrected for when studying maximum longevity. ADDITIONAL

    MOTIVATION: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is
  often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the
  analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing
  value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of
  available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only:
  continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are
  usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible
  relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which
  can cope with different types of variables simultaneously. RESULTS: We
  compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing
  values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest)
  based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or
  regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple
  imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random
  forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a
  test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse
  selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values
  ranging from 10% to 30%. We show that missForest can successfully handle
  missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of
  variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of
  imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and
  non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates
  of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest
  exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with
  high-dimensional data. AVAILABILITY: The package missForest is freely

    Continental-scale maps of plant functional diversity are a fundamental
  piece of data of interest to ecosystem modelers and ecologists, yet such maps
  have been exceedingly hard to generate. The large effort to compile global
  plant functional trait databases largely for the purpose of mapping and
  analyzing the spatial distribution of function has resulted in very sparse
  data matrices thereby limiting progress. Identifying robust methodologies to
  gap fill or impute trait values in these databases is an important objective.
  Here I argue that existing statistical tools from phylogenetic comparative
  methods can be used to rapidly impute values into global plant functional
  trait databases due to the large amount of phylogenetic signal often in trait
  data. In particular, statistical models of phylogenetic signal in traits can
  be generated from existing data and used to predict missing values of closely
  related species often with a high degree of accuracy thereby facilitating the
  continental-scale mapping of plant function. Despite the promise of this
  approach, I also discuss potential pitfalls and future challenges that will
  need to be addressed.%

    Our understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem
  functioning (BEF) applies mainly to fine spatial scales. New research is
  required if we are to extend this knowledge to broader spatial scales that
  are relevant for conservation decisions. Here, we use simulations to examine
  conditions that generate scale dependence of the BEF relationship. We study
  scale by assessing how the BEF relationship (slope and R2) changes when
  habitat patches are spatially aggregated. We find three ways for the BEF
  relationship to be scale-dependent: (i) variation among local patches in
  local ($\alpha$) diversity, (ii) spatial variation in the local BEF
  relationship and (iii) incomplete compositional turnover in species
  composition among patches. The first two cause the slope of the BEF
  relationship to increase moderately with spatial scale, reflecting nonlinear
  averaging of spatial variation in diversity or the BEF relationship. The
  third mechanism results in much stronger scale dependence, with the BEF
  relationship increasing in the rising portion of the species area
  relationship, but then decreasing as it saturates. An analysis of data from
  the Cedar Creek grassland BEF experiment revealed a positive but saturating
  slope of the relationship with scale. Overall, our findings suggest that the
  BEF relationship is likely to be scale dependent.%

  describe a long-term study of grasslands16,17 which shows that primary
  productivity in more diverse plant communities is more resistant to, and
  recovers more fully from, a major drought. The curvilinear relationship we
  observe suggests that each additional species lost from our grasslands had a
  progressively greater impact on drought resistance. Our results support the
  diversity-stability hypothesis5,6,18,19, but not the alternative hypothesis
  that most species are functionally redundant19-21. This study implies that
  the preservation of biodiversity is essential for the maintenance of stable
  productivity in ecosystems.%

    Species diversity is a major determinant of ecosystem productivity,
  stability, invasibility, and nutrient dynamics. Hundreds of studies spanning
  terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures
  are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and
  that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher
  diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity,
  greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and
  nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates
  over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are
  consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a
  common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term
  coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect
  as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought,
  nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change.
  The preservation, conservation, and restoration of biodiversity should be a
  high global priority.%

    Over the last 25 years, research on biodiversity has expanded dramatically,
  fuelled by increasing threats to the natural world. However, the number of
  published studies is heavily weighted towards certain taxa, perhaps
  influencing conservation awareness of and funding for less-popular groups.
  Few studies have systematically quantified these biases, although information
  on this topic is important for informing future research and conservation
  priorities. We investigated: i) which animal taxa are being studied; ii) if
  any taxonomic biases are the same in temperate and tropical regions; iii)
  whether the taxon studied is named in the title of papers on biodiversity,
  perhaps reflecting a perception of what biodiversity is; iv) the geographical
  distribution of biodiversity research, compared with the distribution of
  biodiversity and threatened species; and v) the geographical distribution of
  authors' countries of origin. To do this, we used the search engine Web of
  Science to systematically sample a subset of the published literature with
  ‘biodiversity' in the title. In total 526 research papers were
  screened—5% of all papers in Web of Science with biodiversity in the title.
  For each paper, details on taxonomic group, title phrasing, number of
  citations, study location, and author locations were recorded. Compared to
  the proportions of described species, we identified a considerable taxonomic
  weighting towards vertebrates and an under-representation of invertebrates
  (particularly arachnids and insects) in the published literature. This
  discrepancy is more pronounced in highly cited papers, and in tropical
  regions, with only 43% of biodiversity research in the tropics including
  invertebrates. Furthermore, while papers on vertebrate taxa typically did not
  specify the taxonomic group in the title, the converse was true for
  invertebrate papers. Biodiversity research is also biased geographically:
  studies are more frequently carried out in developed countries with larger
  economies, and for a given level of species or threatened species, tropical
  countries were understudied relative to temperate countries. Finally,
  biodiversity research is disproportionately authored by researchers from
  wealthier countries, with studies less likely to be carried out by scientists
  in lower-GDP nations. Our results highlight the need for a more systematic
  and directed evaluation of biodiversity studies, perhaps informing more
  targeted research towards those areas and taxa most depauperate in research.
  Only by doing so can we ensure that biodiversity research yields results that
  are relevant and applicable to all regions and that the information necessary
  for the conservation of threatened species is available to conservation
  practitioners.%

    MOTIVATION: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets
  with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately, many algorithms for
  gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as
  input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means
  clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even
  with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed,
  therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to
  increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In
  this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data.
  RESULTS: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation
  of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three
  methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute),
  weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the
  methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data
  sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of
  missing data over the range of 1--20% missing values. We show that KNNimpute
  appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value
  estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the
  commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with
  zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide
  recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data
  under a variety of conditions.%

    Animal movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species
  survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on animal movements
  have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database
  of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in
  areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to
  one-third the extent of their movements in areas with a low human footprint.
  We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual animals and
  to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher
  human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of
  animals that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem
  processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease
  transmission. W ith approximately 50 to 70% of Earth's land surface currently
  modified for human activities (1), patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem
  functions worldwide are changing (2). The expanding footprint of human
  activities not only is causing the loss of habitat and biodiversity, but is
  also affecting how animals move through fragmented and disturbed habitats.
  The extent to which animal movements are affected by anthropogenic effects on
  the structure and composition of landscapes and resource changes has been
  explored only in local geographic regions or within single species. Such
  studies typically report decreasing animal movements-for example, as a result
  of habitat fragmentation, barrier effects, or resource changes (3-6)-with
  only a few studies reporting longer movements as a result of habitat loss or
  altered migration routes (7, 8). We conducted a global comparative study of
  how the human footprint affects movements of terrestrial nonvolant mammals,
  using Global Positioning System (GPS) location data of 803 individuals from
  57 mammal species (Fig. 1 and table S2). Mean species mass ranged from 0.49
  to 3940 kg and included herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores (n = 28, 11,
  and 18 species, respectively). For each individual, we annotated locations
  with the Human Footprint Index (HFI), an index with a global extent that
  combines multiple proxies of human influence: the extent of built
  environments, crop land, pasture land, human population density, nighttime
  lights, railways, roads, and navigable waterways (9) (see supplementary
  materials for details). The HFI ranges from 0 (natural environments: e.g.,
  the Brazilian Pantanal) to 50 (high-density built environments: e.g., New
  York City). In addition to the human footprint, we included other covariates
  that are known to influence mammalian movements. Because individuals may need
  to cover a larger area to gather sufficient resources, mammals generally move
  farther in environments with lower productivity (10). To capture this effect,
  we annotated locations with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
  (NDVI), a well-established, satellite-derived measure of resource abundance
  for both herbivores and car-nivores (11). Because an allometric scaling
  relationship shows that animals of greater body size usually move farther
  (12), and because diet may influence movements as a result of differences in
  foraging costs and availability of resource types (13, 14), we annotated the
  database with species averages for body size and dietary guild (i.e.,
  car-nivore, herbivore, or omnivore). We then calculated displacements as the
  distance between subsequent GPS locations of each individual at nine time
  scales (15) ranging from 1 hour to 10 days. For each individual at each time
  scale, we calculated the 0.5 and 0.95 quan-tile of displacement. The
  combination of different time scales and quantile allowed us to examine the
  effect of the human footprint on both the median (0.5 quantile) and
  long-distance (0.95 quan-tile) movements for within-day movements (e.g.,
  1-hour time scale) up to longer time displacements of more than 1 week (e.g.,
  10-day time scale). We used linear mixed-effects models that, in addition to
  all covariates (i.e., NDVI, body mass, diet), also accounted for taxonomy and
  spatial autocorrelation (see supplementary materials for details). We found
  strong negative effects of the human footprint on median and long-distance
  displacements of terrestrial mammals (Fig. 2, Fig. 3A, and table S3).
  Displacements of individuals (across species) living in areas of high
  footprint (HFI = 36) were shorter than displacements of individuals living in
  areas of low footprint (HFI = 0) by as much as a factor of 3. For example,
  median displacements for carnivores over 10 days were 3.3 ± 1.4 km (SE) in
  areas of high footprint versus 6.9 ± 1.3 km in areas of low footprint (Fig.
  2A and table S3). Likewise, the maximum displacement distances for carnivores
  at the 10-day scale averaged 6.6 ± 1.4 km in areas of high footprint versus
  21.5 ± 1.4 km in areas of low footprint (Fig. 2B and table S3). The effect
  was significant on all temporal scales with 8 hours or more between
  locations.%

    Aim: Lizards are ancestrally diurnal, and most of them remain so.
  Nocturnality is common among lizards, but the environmental factors
  associated with lizard nocturnal activity are still unknown. Here, we
  contrasted the ambient temperature and productivity hypotheses, where we
  predicted that cold temperatures will pose a stonger limit to nocturnal
  species richness than diurnal lizards. Moreover, we contrasted the relative
  importance of annual, day and night mean temperatures to pinpoint the drivers
  of nocturnal lizard richness. Location:Mainland Eurasia. Methods: We
  collected distribution range and activity time data for all 1,113 lizard
  species found throughout mainland Eurasia. This represents the largest
  geographical scope to date, for studies of lizard species richness. We
  examined the spatial patterns of nocturnal species richness in relationship
  to diurnal species richness across environmental gradients of ambient
  temperature and productivity. Results: Nocturnal lizards are richest in the
  tropics and in deserts, and their richness decreases with latitude. However,
  nocturnal lizards are absent from the highest latitudes and coldest regions
  inhabited by lizards. Diurnal and nocturnal lizards respond in a similar
  manner to climatic factors. Ambient temperature has a strong influence on
  both, whereas productivity is more tightly related to the proportion of
  nocturnal species. Main conclusions: Nocturnality is widespread among
  Eurasian lizards. However, nocturnal lizards are absent from invariably cold
  regions, and low temperatures seem to be a limiting factor for lizard
  activity period. We suggest that the year-round warm nights of the tropics
  reduce the cost of being active at night and open the nocturnal niche for
  many lizards. In hot deserts, the combination of hot days and aridity
  increases the cost of diurnal activity, whereas nocturnal activity provides a
  shelter from these extreme conditions.%

    In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal
  performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for
  a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and
  ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original
  boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging
  from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to
  fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high
  degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but
  also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an
  unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on
  functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the
  “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are
  defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly
  via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components
  of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework
  explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are
  translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence
  processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved
  by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into
  functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level)
  algorithms.%

    Despite being recognized as a promoter of diversity and a condition for
  local coexistence decades ago, the importance of intraspecific variance has
  been neglected over time in community ecology. Recently, there has been a new
  emphasis on intraspecific variability. Indeed, recent developments in
  trait-based community ecology have underlined the need to integrate variation
  at both the intraspecific as well as interspecific level. We introduce new
  T-statistics ('T' for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and
  interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to
  operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology
  theory. We show that a focus on the distribution of traits at local and
  regional scales combined with original analytical tools can provide unique
  insights into the primary forces structuring communities. {\textcopyright}

    The accumulation of seeds in the soil (the seedbank) can set the template
  for the early regeneration of habitats following disturbance. Seed dispersal
  is an important factor determining the pattern of seed rain, which affects
  the interactions those seeds experience. For this reason, seed dispersal
  should play an important role in structuring forest seedbanks, yet we know
  little about how that happens. Using the functional extirpation of
  frugivorous vertebrates from the island of Guam, together with two nearby
  islands (Saipan and Rota) that each support relatively intact disperser
  assemblages, we aimed to identify the role of vertebrate dispersers in
  structuring forest seedbanks. We sampled the seedbank on Guam where
  dispersers are absent, and compared this with the seedbank on Saipan and Rota
  where they are present. Almost twice as many species found in the seedbank on
  Guam, when compared with Saipan and Rota, had a conspecific adult within 2 m.
  This indicates a strong role of vertebrate dispersal in determining the
  identity of seeds in the seedbank. In addition, on Guam, a greater proportion
  of samples contained no seeds and overall species richness was lower than on
  Saipan. Differences in seed abundance and richness between Guam and Rota were
  less clear, as seedbanks on Rota also contained fewer species than Saipan,
  possibly due to increased post-dispersal seed predation. Our findings suggest
  that vertebrate seed dispersers can have a strong influence on the species
  composition of seedbanks. Regardless of post-dispersal processes, without
  dispersal, seedbanks no longer serve to increase the species pool of recruits
  during regeneration.%

    Species are characterized by physiological, behavioral, and ecological
  attributes that are all subject to varying evolutionary and ecological
  constraints and jointly detemrine species' role and function in ecosystems.
  Attributes such as diet, foraging strata, foraging time, and body size, in
  particular, characterize a large portion of the "Eltonian" niches of species.
  Here we present a global species-level compilation of these key attributes
  for all 9993 and 5400 extant bird and mammal species derived from key
  literature sources. Global handbooks and monographs allowed the consistent
  sourcing of attributes for most species. For diet and foraging stratum we
  followed a defined protocol to translate the verbal descriptions into
  standardized, semiquantitative information about relative importance of
  different categories. Together with body size (continuous) and activity time
  (categorical) this enables a much finer distinction of species' foraging
  ecology than typical categorical guild assignments allow. Attributes lacking
  information for specific species are flagged, and interpolated values based
  on taxonomy are provided instead.The presented data set is limited by, among
  others, these select cases missing observed data, by errors and uncertainty
  in the expert assessment as presented in the literature, and by the lack of
  intraspecific information. However, the standardized and transparent nature
  and complete global coverage of the data set should support an array of
  potential studies in biogeography, community ecology, macroevolution, global
  change biology, and conservation. Potential uses include comparative work
  involving these traits as focal or secondary variables, ecological research
  on the trait or trophic structure of communities, or conservation science
  concerned with the loss of function among species or in ecosystems in a
  changing world. We hope that this publication will spur the sharing,
  collaborative curation, and extension of data to the benefit of a more
  integrative, rigorous, and global biodiversity science.%

    Recent advances in the ecology of food webs underscore the importance of
  detritus and indirect predator-prey effects. However, most research considers
  detritus as an invariable pool and predation as the only interaction between
  carnivores and prey. Carrion consumption, scavenging, is a type of detrital
  feeding that should have widespread consequences for the structure and
  stability of food webs. Providing access to high-quality resources,
  facultative scavenging is a ubiquitous and phylogenetically widespread
  strategy. In this review, we argue that scavenging is underestimated by
  16-fold in food-web research, producing inflated predation rates and
  underestimated indirect effects. Furthermore, more energy is generally
  transferred per link via scavenging than predation. Thus, future food-web
  research should consider scavenging, especially in light of how major global
  changes can affect scavengers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.%

    Trophic interactions play critical roles in structuring biotic communities.
  Understanding variation in trophic interactions among systems provides
  important insights into biodiversity maintenance and conservation. However,
  the relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down trophic processes for
  broad-scale patterns in biodiversity is poorly understood. Here, we used
  global datasets on species richness of vascular plants, mammals and breeding
  birds to evaluate the role of trophic interactions in shaping large-scale
  diversity patterns. Specifically, we used non-recursive structural equation
  models to test for top-down and bottom-up forcing of global species diversity
  patterns among plants and trophic guilds of mammals and birds (carnivores,
  invertivores and herbivores), while accounting for extrinsic environmental
  drivers. The results show that trophic linkages emerged as being more
  important to explaining species richness than extrinsic environmental
  drivers. In particular, there were strong, positive top-down interactions
  between mammal herbivores and plants, and moderate to strong bottom-up and/or
  top-down interactions between herbivores/invertivores and carnivores.
  Estimated trophic interactions for separate biogeographical regions were
  consistent with global patterns. Our findings demonstrate that, after
  accounting for environmental drivers, large-scale species richness patterns
  in plant and vertebrate taxa consistently support trophic interactions
  playing a major role in shaping global patterns in biodiversity. Furthermore,
  these results suggest that top-down forces often play strong complementary
  roles relative to bottom-up drivers in structuring biodiversity patterns
  across trophic levels. These findings underscore the importance of
  integrating trophic forcing mechanisms into studies of biodiversity
  patterns.%
