    1. Recent studies clearly support a positive biodiversity–ecosystem
  functioning (BEF) relationship in phytoplankton. As taxon richness does not
  quantify func-tional diversity, functional approaches have been developed to
  link community functioning to diversity. Compared to terrestrial plant
  communities, only a few studies have validated phytoplankton functional
  approaches in BEF relationships. Furthermore, the ability of functional and
  taxonomic richness measures in pre-dicting ecosystem functioning of natural
  phytoplankton communities has not been compared yet. 2. Here, we analysed the
  BEF relationship using taxonomic and functional (trait cat-egories and
  response groups sensu Reynolds) approaches in a broad-scale phyto-plankton
  dataset from Fennoscandia. First, we analysed how taxonomic and functional
  compositions were related to local environmental predictors. We then compared
  how taxonomic and functional richness performed in predicting resource-use
  efficiency (the yield in phytoplankton biomass standardised by total
  phosphorus) as an ecosystem functioning measure. Finally, we tested whether
  the relationship between ecosystem functioning and taxonomic richness is
  fur-ther enhanced once each of the functional richness measure is also
  considered. 3. Among the approaches, phytoplankton functional trait
  categories as community matrix showed the best correspondence with the local
  environment. The richness of phytoplankton response groups predicted
  ecosystem functioning significantly better than the taxonomic and the
  functional trait category richness —both in the full dataset and in almost
  all Fennoscandian countries. On top of taxonomic richness, only the residual
  variation in response group richness predicted ecosystem functioning
  positively in the entire dataset and in all individual countries. 4. Applying
  functional approaches, reduced complexity of data should come along with
  reduced ecological information. We showed, however, that both functional
  approaches represented some functional redundancy among taxa in a meaningful
  way, and enhanced our ability in predicting community composition from
  envi-ronmental predictors. Moreover, phytoplankton response group richness

    Charisma is a term commonly used in conservation biology to describe
  species. However, as the term “charismatic species” has never been
  properly defined, it needs to be better characterized to fully meet its
  potential in conservation biology. To provide a more complete depiction, we
  collected information from four different sources to define the species
  currently considered to be the most charismatic and to understand what they
  represent to the Western public. First, we asked respondents of two separate
  surveys to identify the 10 animal species that they considered to be the most
  charismatic and associate them with one to six traits: Rare, Endangered,
  Beautiful, Cute, Impressive, and Dangerous. We then identified the wild
  animals featured on the website homepages of the zoos situated in the world's
  100 largest cities as well as on the film posters of all Disney and Pixar
  films, assuming in both cases that the most charismatic species were
  generally chosen to attract viewers. By combining the four approaches, we set
  up a ranked list of the 20 most charismatic animals. The majority are large
  exotic, terrestrial mammals. These species were deemed charismatic, mainly
  because they were regarded as beautiful, impressive, or endangered, although
  no particular trait was discriminated, and species were heterogeneously
  associated with most of the traits. The main social characteristics of
  respondents did not have a significant effect on their choices. These results
  provide a concrete list of the most charismatic species and offer insights
  into the Western public's perception of charismatic species, both of which
  could be helpful to target new species for conservation campaigns.%

    Hunting constitutes one of the most ancient and important practices in the
  history of mankind, impacting the various aspects of human life. In this
  chapter we briefly discuss historical features of hunting, its importance to
  civilization, the motivations that drives people to practice this activity
  and their hunting strategies, the diverse ways of using game animals, and the
  ecological implications of hunting. Identifying the importance of hunting and
  its effects, it is a key to search for strategies that allow the conservation

    Although some organisms have moved to higher elevations and latitudes in
  response to recent climate change, there is little consensus regarding the
  capacity of different species to track rapid climate change via range shifts.
  Understanding species' abilities to shift ranges has important implications
  for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At
  an expanding front, colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of
  reproduction and dispersal. In addition, establishment of viable populations
  requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus,
  species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive rate and ecological
  generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate
  change. Here, we assess current evidence for the relationship between
  leading-edge range shifts and species' traits. We found expected
  relationships for several datasets, including diet breadth in North American
  Passeriformes and egg-laying habitat in British Odonata. However, models
  generally had low explanatory power. Thus, even statistically and
  biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive
  utility for conservation and management. Trait-based range shift forecasts
  face several challenges, including quantifying relevant natural history
  variation across large numbers of species and coupling these data with
  extrinsic factors such as habitat fragmentation and availability.%

    Concern is growing about the consequences of biodiversity loss for
  ecosystem functioning, for the provision of ecosystem services, and for human
  well being. Experimental evidence for a relationship between biodiversity and
  ecosystem process rates is compelling, but the issue remains contentious.
  Here, we present the first rigorous quantitative assessment of this
  relationship through meta-analysis of experimental work spanning 50 years to
  June 2004. We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in
  grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or
  measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if
  biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity
  change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community
  level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects
  decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements
  manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures
  ('insurance' effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on
  performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed
  here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most.
  Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to
  biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.%

    Theory on trophic interactions predicts that predators increase plant
  biomass by feeding on herbivores, an indirect interaction called a trophic
  cascade. Theory also predicts that predators feeding on predators, or
  intraguild predation, will weaken trophic cascades. Although past syntheses
  have confirmed cascading effects of terrestrial arthropod predators, we lack
  a comprehensive analysis for vertebrate insectivores-which by virtue of their
  body size and feeding habits are often top predators in these systems-and of
  how intraguild predation mediates trophic cascade strength. We report here on
  a meta-analysis of 113 experiments documenting the effects of insectivorous
  birds, bats, or lizards on predaceous arthropods, herbivorous arthropods, and
  plants. Although vertebrate insectivores fed as intraguild predators,
  strongly reducing predaceous arthropods (38%), they nevertheless suppressed
  herbivores (39%), indirectly reduced plant damage (40%), and increased plant
  biomass (14%). Furthermore, effects of vertebrate insectivores on predatory
  and herbivorous arthropods were positively correlated. Effects were strongest
  on arthropods and plants in communities with abundant predaceous arthropods
  and strong intraguild predation, but weak in communities depauperate in
  arthropod predators and intraguild predation. The naturally occurring ratio
  of arthropod predators relative to herbivores varied tremendously among the
  studied communities, and the skew to predators increased with site primary
  productivity and in trees relative to shrubs. Although intraguild predation
  among arthropod predators has been shown to weaken herbivore suppression, we
  find this paradigm does not extend to vertebrate insectivores in these
  communities. Instead, vertebrate intraguild preda-tion is associated with
  strengthened trophic cascades, and insectivores function as dominant
  predators in terrestrial plant-arthropod communities.%

    Abstract Animal assemblages fulfill a critical set of ecological functions
  for ecosystems that may be altered substantially as climate change-induced
  distribution changes lead to community disaggregation and reassembly. We
  combine species and community perspectives to assess the consequences of
  projected geographic range changes for the diverse functional attributes of
  avian assemblages worldwide. Assemblage functional structure is projected to
  change highly unevenly across space. These differences arise from both
  changes in the number of species and changes in species’ relative local
  functional redundancy or distinctness. They sometimes result in substantial
  losses of functional diversity that could have severe consequences for
  ecosystem health. Range expansions may counter functional losses in
  high-latitude regions, but offer little compensation in many tropical and
  subtropical biomes. Future management of local community function and
  ecosystem services thus relies on understanding the global dynamics of
  species distributions and multiscale approaches that include the
  biogeographic context of species traits.%

    Many species have already shifted their distributions in response to recent
  climate change. Here, we aimed at predicting the future breeding
  distributions of European birds under climate, land-use, and dispersal
  scenarios. We predicted current and future distributions of 409 species
  within an ensemble forecast framework using seven species distribution models
  (SDMs), five climate scenarios and three emission and land-use scenarios. We
  then compared results from SDMs using climate-only variables, habitat-only
  variables or both climate and habitat variables. In order to account for a
  species' dispersal abilities, we used natal dispersal estimates and developed
  a probabilistic method that produced a dispersal scenario intermediate
  between the null and full dispersal scenarios generally considered in such
  studies. We then compared results from all scenarios in terms of future
  predicted range changes, range shifts, and variations in species richness.
  Modeling accuracy was better with climate-only variables than with
  habitat-only variables, and better with both climate and habitat variables.
  Habitat models predicted smaller range shifts and smaller variations in range
  size and species richness than climate models. Using both climate and habitat
  variables, it was predicted that the range of 71% of the species would
  decrease by 2050, with a 335 km median shift. Predicted variations in species
  richness showed large decreases in the southern regions of Europe, as well as
  increases, mainly in Scandinavia and northern Russia. The partial dispersal
  scenario was significantly different from the full dispersal scenario for 25%
  of the species, resulting in the local reduction of the future predicted
  species richness of up to 10%. We concluded that the breeding range of most
  European birds will decrease in spite of dispersal abilities close to a full
  dispersal hypothesis, and that given the contrasted predictions obtained when
  modeling climate change only and land-use change only, both scenarios must be
  taken into consideration. 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.%

    The response and effect trait framework, if supported empirically, would
  provide for powerful and general predictions about how biodiversity loss
  leads to loss in ecosystem function. This framework proposes that species
  traits will explain how different species respond to disturbance (i.e.
  response traits) as well as their contribution to ecosystem function (i.e.
  effect traits). However, predictive response and effect traits remain elusive
  for most systems. Here, we use data on crop pollination services provided by
  native, wild bees to explore the role of six commonly used species traits in
  determining both species' response to land-use change and the subsequent
  effect on crop pollination. Analyses were conducted in parallel for three
  crop systems (watermelon, cranberry, and blueberry) located within the same
  geographical region (mid-Atlantic USA). Bee species traits did not strongly
  predict species' response to land-use change, and the few traits that were
  weakly predictive were not consistent across crops. Similarly, no trait
  predicted species' overall functional contribution in any of the three crop
  systems, although body size was a good predictor of per capita efficiency in
  two systems. Overall we were unable to make generalizable predictions
  regarding species responses to land-use change and its effect on the delivery
  of crop pollination services. Pollinator traits may be useful for
  understanding ecological processes in some systems, but thus far the promise
  of traits-based ecology has yet to be fulfilled for pollination ecology. This

    Summary Two alternative frameworks have been proposed to partition
  compositional dissimilarity into replacement and nestedness-resultant
  component or into replacement and richness-difference components. These are,
  respectively, the BAS (Baselga 2010, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 19,
  134–143) and POD (Podani \& Schmera . Oikos, 120, 1625–1638) frameworks.
  We conduct a systematic comparison of parallel components in alternative
  approaches. We test whether the replacement components derived from the BAS
  and POD frameworks are independent of richness difference. We also evaluate
  whether previously reported tests of monotonicity between indices and
  ecological processes are informative to assess the performance of indices.
  Finally, we illustrate the consequences of differences between the BAS and
  POD frameworks using the North American freshwater fish fauna as an empirical
  example. In the BAS framework, the nestedness-resultant component (βjne or
  βsne) accounts only for richness differences derived from nested patterns
  while, in the POD framework, richness-difference dissimilarity (βrich or
  βrich.s) accounts for all kind of richness differences. Likewise, the
  replacement components of both alternative methods account for different
  concepts. Only the replacement component of the BAS framework (βjtu or
  βsim) is independent of richness difference, while the parallel component in
  the POD framework (β−3 or β−3.s) is not (i.e. it is mathematically
  constrained by richness difference). Therefore, only the BAS framework allows
  separating (i) the variation in species composition derived from species
  replacement which is independent of richness difference (i.e. not
  mathematically constrained by it) and (ii) the variation in species
  composition derived from nested patterns.%

    Effective and targeted conservation action requires detailed information
  about species, their distribution, systematics and ecology as well as the
  distribution of threat processes which affect them. Knowledge of reptilian
  diversity remains surprisingly disparate, and innovative means of gaining
  rapid insight into the status of reptiles are needed in order to highlight
  urgent conservation cases and inform environmental policy with appropriate
  biodiversity information in a timely manner. We present the first ever global
  analysis of extinction risk in reptiles, based on a random representative
  sample of 1500 species (16% of all currently known species). To our
  knowledge, our results provide the first analysis of the global conservation
  status and distribution patterns of reptiles and the threats affecting them,
  highlighting conservation priorities and knowledge gaps which need to be
  addressed urgently to ensure the continued survival of the world's reptiles.
  Nearly one in five reptilian species are threatened with extinction, with
  another one in five species classed as Data Deficient. The proportion of
  threatened reptile species is highest in freshwater environments, tropical
  regions and on oceanic islands, while data deficiency was highest in tropical
  areas, such as Central Africa and Southeast Asia, and among fossorial
  reptiles. Our results emphasise the need for research attention to be
  focussed on tropical areas which are experiencing the most dramatic rates of
  habitat loss, on fossorial reptiles for which there is a chronic lack of
  data, and on certain taxa such as snakes for which extinction risk may
  currently be underestimated due to lack of population information.
  Conservation actions specifically need to mitigate the effects of
  human-induced habitat loss and harvesting, which are the predominant threats
  to reptiles. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    One-fifth of the world's reptiles are currently estimated as threatened
  with extinction, primarily due to the immediate threats of habitat loss and
  overexploitation. Climate change presents an emerging slow-acting threat.
  However, few IUCN Red List assessments for reptiles explicitly consider the
  potential role of climate change as a threat. Thus, climate change
  vulnerability assessments can complement existing Red List assessments and
  highlight further, emerging priorities for conservation action. Here we
  present the first trait-based global climate change vulnerability assessment
  for reptiles to estimate the climate change vulnerability of a random
  representative sample of 1498 species of reptiles. We collected
  species-specific traits relating to three dimensions of climate change,
  sensitivity, low adaptability, and exposure, which we combined to assess
  overall vulnerability. We found 80.5% of species highly sensitive to climate
  change, primarily due to habitat specialisation, while 48% had low
  adaptability and 58% had high exposure. Overall, 22% of species assessed were
  highly vulnerable to climate change. Hotspots of climate change vulnerability
  did not always overlap with hotspots of threatened species richness, with
  most of the vulnerable species found in northwestern South America,
  southwestern USA, Sri Lanka, the Himalayan Arc, Central Asia and southern
  India. Most families were found to be significantly more vulnerable to
  climate change than expected by chance. Our findings build on previous work
  on reptile extinction risk to provide an overview of the risk posed to
  reptiles by climate change. Despite significant data gaps for a number of
  traits, we recommend that these findings are integrated into reassessments of
  species' extinction risk, to monitor both immediate and slow-acting threats
  to reptiles.%

    Natural populations consist of phenotypically diverse individuals that
  exhibit variation in their demographic parameters and intra- and
  inter-specific interactions. Recent experimental work indicates that such
  variation can have significant ecological effects. However, ecological models
  typically disregard this variation and focus instead on trait means and total
  population density. Under what situations is this simplification appropriate?
  Why might intraspecific variation alter ecological dynamics? In this review
  we synthesize recent theory and identify six general mechanisms by which
  trait variation changes the outcome of ecological interactions. These
  mechanisms include several direct effects of trait variation per se and
  indirect effects arising from the role of genetic variation in trait
  evolution. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.%

  However, despite the considerable number of strategies to measure it, few and
  limited approaches exist for categorical traits. Here, we used the concept of
  Shannon entropy and propose the $\delta$ statistic for evaluating the degree
  of phylogenetic signal between a phylogeny and categorical traits.ResultsWe
  validated $\delta$ as a measure of phylogenetic signal: the higher the
  $\delta$-value the higher the degree of phylogenetic signal between a given
  tree and a trait. Based on simulated data we proposed a threshold-based
  classification test to pinpoint cases of phylogenetic signal. The assessment
  of the test's specificity and sensitivity suggested that the $\delta$
  approach should only be applied to 20 or more species. We have further tested
  the performance of $\delta$ in scenarios of branch length and topology
  uncertainty, unbiased and biased trait evolution and trait saturation. Our
  results showed that $\delta$ may be applied in a wide range of phylogenetic
  contexts. Finally, we investigated our method in 14 360 mammalian gene trees
  and found that olfactory receptor genes are significantly associated with the
  mammalian activity patterns, a result that is congruent with expectations and
  experiments from the literature. Our application shows that $\delta$ can
  successfully detect molecular signatures of phenotypic evolution. We conclude
  that $\delta$ represents a useful measure of the strength of phylogenetic
  signal since many phenotypes can only be measured in
  categories.Availabilityhttps://github.com/mrborges23/delta_statisticSupplementary

    Question: Is Rao's quadratic entropy a suitable measure of functional
  diversity if several traits are considered? Methods: It is checked whether
  Rao's quadratic entropy (FDQ) satisfies a priori criteria suggested by Mason
  et al. A real data set is used to show that there are often zeros in
  abundance distributions which maximize functional diversity. Results and
  Conclusion: FDQ fulfils all a priori criteria and it surpasses other proposed
  indices, because it includes species abundances and more than one trait.
  Therefore, it seems to be an improvement compared to measures of functional
  diversity that are currently available. An unexpected property of FDQ is that
  its value may decrease if species richness increases. The reason is that
  functional diversity is influenced by both species- abundance based diversity
  and differences among species. Introduction of a new species into the
  community increases the species-abundance based diversity, while it may
  decrease the average dissimilarity among species.%

    Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree
  depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the
  same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for
  forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest
  becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers
  depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the
  correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each
  node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Freund and
  Schapire[1996]), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal
  estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show
  the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.
  Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas
  are also applicable to regression. 1%

    A wealth of information on metabolic parameters of a species can be
  inferred from observations on species that are phylogenetically related.
  Phylogeny-based information can complement direct empirical evidence, and is
  particularly valuable if experiments on the species of interest are not
  feasible. The PhyloPars web server provides a statistically consistent method
  that combines an incomplete set of empirical observations with the species
  phylogeny to produce a complete set of parameter estimates for all species.
  It builds upon a state-of-the-art evolutionary model, extended with the
  ability to handle missing data. The resulting approach makes optimal use of
  all available information to produce estimates that can be an order of
  magnitude more accurate than ad-hoc alternatives. Uploading a phylogeny and
  incomplete feature matrix suffices to obtain estimates of all missing values,
  along with a measure of certainty. Real-time cross-validation provides
  further insight in the accuracy and bias expected for estimated values. The
  server allows for easy, efficient estimation of metabolic parameters, which
  can benefit a wide range of fields including systems biology and ecology.

    Environmental filtering, where the environment selects against certain
  species, is thought to be a major mechanism structuring communities. However,
  recent criticisms cast doubt on our ability to accurately infer filtering
  because competition can give rise to patterns identical to those caused by
  environmental filtering. While experiments can distinguish mechanisms,
  observational patterns are especially problematic. The environment determines
  community composition not only directly via survival, but also by influencing
  competition. If species population growth rates covary with environmental
  gradients, then outcomes of competitive exclusion will also vary with the
  environment. Here, we argue that observational studies remain valuable, but
  inferences about the importance of the environment cannot rely on
  compositional data alone, and that species abundances, population growth, or
  traits must be correlated with the environment.%

    1. The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain
  biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides.
  These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity
  that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet
  how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches
  filled by species. 2. Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that
  account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures
  of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution
  of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities
  and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful
  for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3. In
  order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with
  ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what
  species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions,
  examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species
  richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD
  offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness.
  4. Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is
  complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show
  individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes
  in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can
  explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5.
  Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that
  potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory
  power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration
  decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or
  preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems.%

    1. The geographical range sizes of individual species vary considerably in
  extent, although the factors underlying this variation remain poorly
  understood, and could include a number of ecological and evolutionary
  processes. A favoured explanation for range size variation is that this
  result from differences in fundamental niche breadths, suggesting a key role
  for physiology in determining range size, although to date empirical tests of
  these ideas remain limited. 2. Here we explore relationships between thermal
  physiology and biogeography, whilst controlling for possible differences in
  dispersal ability and phylogenetic relatedness, across 14 ecologically
  similar congeners which differ in geographical range extent; European diving
  beetles of the genus Deronectes Sharp (Coleoptera, Dytiscidae). Absolute
  upper and lower temperature tolerance and acclimatory abilities are
  determined for populations of each species, following acclimation in the
  laboratory. 3. Absolute thermal tolerance range is the best predictor of both
  species' latitudinal range extent and position, differences in dispersal
  ability (based on wing size) apparently being less important in this group.
  In addition, species' northern and southern range limits are related to their
  tolerance of low and high temperatures respectively. In all cases, absolute
  temperature tolerances, rather than acclimatory abilities are the best
  predictors of range parameters, whilst the use of independent contrasts
  suggested that species' thermal acclimation abilities may also relate to
  biogeography, although increased acclimatory ability does not appear to be
  associated with increased range size. 4. Our study is the first to provide
  empirical support for a relationship between thermal physiology and range
  size variation in widespread and restricted species, conducted using the same
  experimental design, within a phylogenetically and ecologically controlled
  framework.%

    Large floristic datasets that purportedly represent the diversity and
  composition of the Amazon tree flora are being widely used to draw
  conclusions about the patterns and evolution of Amazon plant diversity, but
  these datasets are fundamentally flawed in both their methodology and the
  resulting content. We have assembled a comprehensive dataset of Amazonian
  seed plant species from published sources that includes falsifiable data
  based on voucher specimens identified by taxonomic specialists. This growing
  list should serve as a basis for addressing the long-standing debate on the
  number of plant species in the Amazon, as well as for downstream ecological
  and evolutionary analyses aimed at understanding the origin and function of
  the exceptional biodiversity of the vast Amazonian forests.Recent debates on
  the number of plant species in the vast lowland rain forests of the Amazon
  have been based largely on model estimates, neglecting published checklists
  based on verified voucher data. Here we collate taxonomically verified
  checklists to present a list of seed plant species from lowland Amazon rain
  forests. Our list comprises 14,003 species, of which 6,727 are trees. These
  figures are similar to estimates derived from nonparametric ecological
  models, but they contrast strongly with predictions of much higher tree
  diversity derived from parametric models. Based on the known proportion of
  tree species in neotropical lowland rain forest communities as measured in
  complete plot censuses, and on overall estimates of seed plant diversity in
  Brazil and in the neotropics in general, it is more likely that tree
  diversity in the Amazon is closer to the lower estimates derived from
  nonparametric models. Much remains unknown about Amazonian plant diversity,
  but this taxonomically verified dataset provides a valid starting point for
  macroecological and evolutionary studies aimed at understanding the origin,
  evolution, and ecology of the exceptional biodiversity of Amazonian forests.%

    Owing to the conceptual complexity of functional diversity (FD), a
  multitude of different methods are available for measuring it, with most
  being operational at only a small range of spatial scales. This causes
  uncertainty in ecological interpretations and limits the potential to
  generalize findings across studies or compare patterns across scales. We
  solve this problem by providing a unified framework expanding on and
  integrating existing approaches. The framework, based on trait probability
  density (TPD), is the first to fully implement the Hutchinsonian concept of
  the niche as a probabilistic hypervolume in estimating FD. This novel
  approach could revolutionize FD-based research by allowing quantification of
  the various FD components from organismal to macroecological scales, and
  allowing seamless transitions between scales. Functional trait diversity, in
  other words the variation of traits between organisms, can be used to address
  a great number of pressing ecological questions. Consequently, trait-based
  approaches are increasingly being used by ecologists.However, functional
  diversity comprises several components that can be evaluated at different
  spatial scales. Because of this conceptual complexity, there is an
  overabundance of disparate approaches for estimating it, which leads to
  confusion among users and hampers the comparability of different studies.A
  single mathematical framework encompassing different approaches while
  providing a seamless continuity between spatial scales is needed.Reconciling
  the approaches based on the concept of the niche as a hypervolume and those
  that consider traits in probabilistic terms is the first step towards the
  foundation of a unified framework.%

    Abstract Biodiversity conservation strategies increasingly target
  maintaining evolutionary history and the resilience of ecosystem function,
  not just species richness (SR). This has led to the emergence of two metrics
  commonly proposed as tools for decision making: phylogenetic diversity (PD)
  and functional diversity (FD). Yet, the extent to which they are
  interchangeable remains poorly understood. We explore shifts in and
  relationships between FD and PD of bird communities across a disturbance
  gradient in Borneo, from old-growth tropical forest to oil palm plantation.
  We show a marked decline in PD, and an increase in phylogenetic mean nearest
  taxon distance from forest to oil palm, in line with declining SR across the
  gradient. However, phylogenetic mean pairwise distance is constrained by
  forest logging more than by conversion to oil palm, taking account of SR. The
  decline in FD across the gradient is less severe than in PD, with all metrics
  indicating relatively high trait diversity in oil palm despite low SR,
  although functional redundancy is much reduced. Accounting for SR, levels of
  functional over- or under-dispersion of bird communities are strongly coupled
  to habitat disturbance level rather than to any equivalent phylogenetic
  metric. Policy implications. We suggest that while phylogenetic diversity
  (PD) is an improvement on species richness as a proxy for functional
  diversity (FD), conservation decisions based on phylogenetic diversity alone
  cannot reliably safeguard maximal functional diversity. Thus, phylogenetic
  diversity and functional diversity are related but still complementary.
  Priority setting exercises should use these metrics in combination to
  identify conservation targets.%

  countryside species area relationship (SAR) model to estimate the mammals,
  birds, amphibians and reptiles species lost (i.e. species 'committed to
  extinction') due to agricultural land use within each of the 804 terrestrial
  ecoregion. These species lost estimates were combined with high spatial
  resolution global maps of crop yields to calculate species lost per ton for
  170 crops in 184 countries. Finally, the impacts per ton were linked with the
  bilateral trade data of crop products between producing and consuming
  countries from FAO, to calculate the land use biodiversity impacts embodied
  in international crop trade and consumption. We found that 83% of total
  species loss is incurred due to agriculture land use devoted for domestic
  consumption whereas 17% is due to export production. Exports from Indonesia
  to USA and China embody highest impacts (20 species lost at the regional
  level each). In general, industrialized countries with high per capita GDP
  tend to be major net importers of biodiversity impacts from developing
  tropical countries. Results show that embodied land area is not a good proxy
  for embodied biodiversity impacts in trade flows, as crops occupying little
  global area such as sugarcane, palm oil, rubber and coffee have
  disproportionately high biodiversity impacts.%

    Trait-based ecology has been developed for decades to infer ecosystem
  responses to stressors based on the functional structure of communities, yet
  its value in species-poor systems is largely unknown. Here, we used an
  extensive dataset in a Spanish region highly prone to non-native fish
  invasions (15 catchments, N = 389 sites) to assess for the first time how
  species-poor communities respond to large-scale environmental gradients using
  a taxonomic and functional trait-based approach in riverine fish. We examined
  total species richness and three functional trait-based indices available
  when many sites have ≤ 3 species (specialization, FSpe; originality, FOri
  and entropy, FEnt). We assessed the responses of these taxonomic and
  functional indices along gradients of altitude, water pollution, physical
  habitat degradation and non-native fish biomass. Whilst species richness was
  relatively sensitive to spatial effects, functional diversity indices were
  responsive across natural and anthropogenic gradients. All four diversity
  measures declined with altitude but this decline was modulated by physical
  habitat degradation (richness, FSpe and FEnt) and the non-native:total fish
  biomass ratio (FSpe and FOri) in ways that varied between indices.
  Furthermore, FSpe and FOri were significantly correlated with Total Nitrogen.
  Non-native fish were a major component of the taxonomic and functional
  structure of fish communities, raising concerns about potential misdiagnosis
  between invaded and environmentally-degraded river reaches. Such misdiagnosis
  was evident in a regional fish index widely used in official monitoring
  programs. We recommend the application of FSpe and FOri to extensive datasets
  from monitoring programs in order to generate valuable cross-system
  information about the impacts of non-native species and habitat degradation,
  even in species-poor systems. Scoring non-native species apart from habitat
  degradation in the indices used to determine ecosystem health is essential to
  develop better management strategies.%

    Top carnivores have suffered widespread global declines, with
  well-documented effects on mesopredators and herbivores. We know less about
  how carnivores affect ecosystems through scavenging. Tasmania's top
  carnivore, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), has suffered severe
  disease-induced population declines, providing a natural experiment on the
  role of scavenging in structuring communities. Using remote cameras and
  experimentally placed carcasses, we show that mesopredators consume more
  carrion in areas where devils have declined. Carcass consumption by the two
  native mesopredators was best predicted by competition for carrion, whereas
  consumption by the invasive mesopredator, the feral cat (Felis catus), was
  better predicted by the landscape-level abundance of devils, suggesting a
  relaxed landscape of fear where devils are suppressed. Reduced discovery of
  carcasses by devils was balanced by the increased discovery by mesopredators.
  Nonetheless, carcasses persisted approximately 2.6-fold longer where devils
  have declined, highlighting their importance for rapid carrion removal. The
  major beneficiary of increased carrion availability was the forest raven
  (Corvus tasmanicus). Population trends of ravens increased 2.2-fold from 1998
  to 2017, the period of devil decline, but this increase occurred
  Tasmania-wide, making the cause unclear. This case study provides a
  little-studied potential mechanism for mesopredator release, with broad
  relevance to the vast areas of the world that have suffered carnivore
  declines.%

    Managing ecosystems to ensure the provision of multiple ecosystem services
  is a key challenge for applied ecology. Functional traits are receiving
  increasing attention as the main ecological attributes by which different
  organisms and biological communities influence ecosystem services through
  their effects on underlying ecosystem processes. Here we synthesize concepts
  and empirical evidence on linkages between functional traits and ecosystem
  services across different trophic levels. Most of the 247 studies reviewed
  considered plants and soil invertebrates, but quantitative trait–service
  associations have been documented for a range of organisms and ecosystems,
  illustrating the wide applicability of the trait approach. Within each
  trophic level, specific processes are affected by a combination of traits
  while particular key traits are simultaneously involved in the control of
  multiple processes. These multiple associations between traits and ecosystem
  processes can help to identify predictable trait–service clusters that
  depend on several trophic levels, such as clusters of traits of plants and
  soil organisms that underlie nutrient cycling, herbivory, and fodder and
  fibre production. We propose that the assessment of trait–service clusters
  will represent a crucial step in ecosystem service monitoring and in
  balancing the delivery of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, services in
  ecosystem management.%

    Summary Bees are a functionally important and economically valuable group,
  but are threatened by land-use conversion and intensification. Such pressures
  are not expected to affect all species identically; rather, they are likely
  to be mediated by the species' ecological traits. Understanding which types
  of species are most vulnerable under which land uses is an important step
  towards effective conservation planning. We collated occurrence and abundance
  data for 257 bee species at 1584 European sites from surveys reported in 30
  published papers (70 056 records) and combined them with species-level
  ecological trait data. We used mixed-effects models to assess the importance
  of land use (land-use class, agricultural use-intensity and a remotely-sensed
  measure of vegetation), traits and trait × land-use interactions, in
  explaining species occurrence and abundance. Species' sensitivity to land use
  was most strongly influenced by flight season duration and foraging range,
  but also by niche breadth, reproductive strategy and phenology, with effects
  that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban habitats. Synthesis and
  applications. Rather than targeting particular species or settings,
  conservation actions may be more effective if focused on mitigating
  situations where species' traits strongly and negatively interact with
  land-use pressures. We find evidence that low-intensity agriculture can
  maintain relatively diverse bee communities; in more intensive settings,
  added floral resources may be beneficial, but will require careful placement
  with respect to foraging ranges of smaller bee species. Protection of
  semi-natural habitats is essential, however; in particular, conversion to
  urban environments could have severe effects on bee diversity and pollination
  services. Our results highlight the importance of exploring how ecological
  traits mediate species responses to human impacts, but further research is
  needed to enhance the predictive ability of such analyses.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A key measure of humanity's global impact is by how much it has increased
  species extinction rates. Familiar statements are that these are 100–1000
  times pre-human or background extinction levels. Estimating recent rates is
  straightforward, but establishing a background rate for comparison is not.
  Previous researchers chose an approximate benchmark of 1 extinction per
  million species per year (E/MSY). We explored disparate lines of evidence
  that suggest a substantially lower estimate. Fossil data yield direct
  estimates of extinction rates, but they are temporally coarse, mostly limited
  to marine hard-bodied taxa, and generally involve genera not species. Based
  on these data, typical background loss is 0.01 genera per million genera per
  year. Molecular phylogenies are available for more taxa and ecosystems, but
  it is debated whether they can be used to estimate separately speciation and
  extinction rates. We selected data to address known concerns and used them to
  determine median extinction estimates from statistical distributions of
  probable values for terrestrial plants and animals. We then created
  simulations to explore effects of violating model assumptions. Finally, we
  compiled estimates of diversification—the difference between speciation and
  extinction rates for different taxa. Median estimates of extinction rates
  ranged from 0.023 to 0.135 E/MSY. Simulation results suggested over- and
  under-estimation of extinction from individual phylogenies partially canceled
  each other out when large sets of phylogenies were analyzed. There was no
  evidence for recent and widespread pre-human overall declines in diversity.
  This implies that average extinction rates are less than average
  diversification rates. Median diversification rates were 0.05–0.2 new
  species per million species per year. On the basis of these results, we
  concluded that typical rates of background extinction may be closer to 0.1
  E/MSY. Thus, current extinction rates are 1,000 times higher than natural
  background rates of extinction and future rates are likely to be 10,000 times
  higher. Estimaci{\'{o}}n de la Tasa Normal de Extinci{\'{o}}n de Especies Una
  medida clave del impacto global de la humanidad es cu{\'{a}}nto han
  incrementado las tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n de las especies. Las declaraciones
  conocidas establecen que estas son 100 – 1,000 veces los niveles de
  extinci{\'{o}}n pre-humanos o de fondo. Estimar las tasas recientes es un
  proceso directo, pero establecer una tasa de fondo para comparar no lo es.
  Investigadores previos han elegido un punto de referencia aproximado de una
  extinci{\'{o}}n por mill{\'{o}}n de especies por a{\~{n}}o (E/MEA).
  Exploramos l{\'{i}}neas dispares de evidencia que sugieren un estimado
  sustancialmente m{\'{a}}s bajo. Los datos f{\'{o}}siles producen estimados
  directos de las tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n, pero son temporalmente burdos, en
  su mayor{\'{i}}a limitados a los taxones marinos de cuerpos duros, y
  generalmente involucran a los g{\'{e}}neros y no a las especies.
  Bas{\'{a}}ndonos en estos datos, la p{\'{e}}rdida de fondo t{\'{i}}pica es de
  0.01 g{\'{e}}neros por mill{\'{o}}n de g{\'{e}}neros por a{\~{n}}o. Las
  filogenias moleculares est{\'{a}}n disponibles para m{\'{a}}s taxones y
  ecosistemas, pero se debate si pueden usarse para estimar por separado las
  tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n y especiaci{\'{o}}n. Seleccionamos datos para
  dirigirnos a asuntos conocidos y los usamos para determinar los estimados de
  extinci{\'{o}}n medios a partir de distribuciones estad{\'{i}}sticas de
  valores probables para plantas y animales terrestres. Despu{\'{e}}s creamos
  simulaciones para explorar los efectos de las suposiciones del modelo de
  violaci{\'{o}}n. Finalmente, recopilamos los estimados de
  diversificaci{\'{o}}n – la diferencia entre las tasas de especiaci{\'{o}}n
  y extinci{\'{o}}n para taxones diferentes. Los estimados medios de las tasas
  de extinci{\'{o}}n variaron desde 0.023 hasta 0.135 E/MEA. Los resultados de
  la simulaci{\'{o}}n sugirieron una sobre- y subestimaci{\'{o}}n de la
  extinci{\'{o}}n a partir filogenias individuales que se cancelaron unas a
  otras cuando se analizaron conjuntos grandes de filogenias. No hubo evidencia
  de declinaciones generales pre-humanas, recientes y extensas en la
  diversidad. Esto implica que las tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n promedio son
  menores a las tasas de diversificaci{\'{o}}n promedio. Las tasas medias de
  diversificaci{\'{o}}n fueron 0.05 – 0.2 especies nuevas por mill{\'{o}}n de
  especies por a{\~{n}}o. Con base en estos resultados, concluimos que las
  t{\'{i}}picas tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n de fondo pueden ser m{\'{a}}s cercanas
  a 0.1 E/MEA. As{\'{i}}, las tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n actuales son mil veces
  m{\'{a}}s altas que las tasas naturales de extinci{\'{o}}n de fondo y que las
  tasas futuras probablemente sean 10, 000 veces m{\'{a}}s altas.%

    Human activity is causing wild populations to experience rapid trait change
  and local extirpation. The resulting effects on intraspecific variation could
  have substantial consequences for ecological processes and ecosystem
  services. Although researchers have long acknowledged that variation among
  species influences the surrounding environment, only recently has evidence
  accumulated for the ecological importance of variation within species. We
  conducted a meta-analysis comparing the ecological effects of variation
  within a species (intraspecific effects) with the effects of replacement or
  removal of that species (species effects). We evaluated direct and indirect
  ecological responses, including changes in abundance (or biomass), rates of
  ecological processes and changes in community composition. Our results show
  that intraspecific effects are often comparable to, and sometimes stronger
  than, species effects. Species effects tend to be larger for direct
  ecological responses (for example, through consumption), whereas
  intraspecific effects and species effects tend to be similar for indirect
  responses (for example, through trophic cascades). Intraspecific effects are
  especially strong when indirect interactions alter community composition. Our
  results summarize data from the first generation of studies examining the
  relative ecological effects of intraspecific variation. Our conclusions can
  help inform the design of future experiments and the formulation of
  strategies to quantify and conserve biodiversity.%

    1. Range management is based on the response of plant species and
  communities to grazing intensity. The identification of easily measured plant
  functional traits that consistently predict grazing response in a wide
  spectrum of rangelands would be a major advance. 2. Sets of species from
  temperate subhumid upland grasslands of Argentina and Israel, grazed by
  cattle, were analysed to find out whether: (i) plants with contrasting
  grazing responses differed in terms of easily measured vegetative and
  life-history traits; (ii) their grazing response could be predicted from
  those traits; (iii) these patterns differed between the two countries. Leaf
  mass, area, specific area (SLA) and toughness were measured on 83 Argentine
  and 19 Israeli species. Species were classified by grazing response
  (grazing-susceptible or grazing-resistant) and plant height ( 40 cm) as well
  as by life history (annual or perennial) and taxonomy (monocotyledon or
  dicotyledon). 3. Similar plant traits were associated with a specific
  response to grazing in both Argentina and Israel. Grazing-resistant species
  were shorter in height, and had smaller, more tender, leaves, with higher SLA
  than grazing-susceptible species. Grazing resistance was associated with both
  avoidance traits (small height and leaf size) and tolerance traits (high
  SLA). Leaf toughness did not contribute to grazing resistance and may be
  related to selection for canopy dominance. 4. Plant height was the best
  single predictor of grazing response, followed by leaf mass. The best
  prediction of species grazing response was achieved by combining plant
  height, life history and leaf mass. SLA was a comparatively poor predictor of
  grazing response. 5. The ranges of plant traits, and some correlation
  patterns between them, differed markedly between species sets from Argentina
  and Israel. However, the significant relationships between plant traits and
  grazing response were maintained. 6. The results of this exploratory study
  suggest that prediction of grazing responses on the basis of easily measured
  plant traits is feasible and consistent between similar grazing systems in
  different regions. The results challenge the precept that intense cattle
  grazing necessarily favours species with tough, unpalatable, leaves.%

    Among the statistical methods available to control for phylogenetic
  autocorrelation in ecological data, those based on eigenfunction analysis of
  the phylogenetic distance matrix among the species are becoming increasingly
  important tools. Here, we evaluate a range of criteria to select eigenvectors
  extracted from a phylogenetic distance matrix (using phylogenetic eigenvector
  regression, PVR) that can be used to measure the level of phylogenetic signal
  in ecological data and to study correlated evolution. We used a principal
  coordinate analysis to represent the phylogenetic relationships among 209
  species of Carnivora by a series of eigenvectors, which were then used to
  model log-transformed body size. We first conducted a series of PVRs in which
  we increased the number of eigenvectors from 1 to 70, following the sequence
  of their associated eigenvalues. Second, we also investigated three
  non-sequential approaches based on the selection of 1) eigenvectors
  significantly correlated with body size, 2) eigenvectors selected by a
  standard stepwise algorithm, and 3) the combination of eigenvectors that
  minimizes the residual phylogenetic autocorrelation. We mapped the mean
  specific component of body size to evaluate how these selection criteria
  affect the interpretation of non-phylogenetic signal in Bergmann's rule. For
  comparison, the same patterns were analyzed using autoregressive model (ARM)
  and phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS). Despite the robustness of
  PVR to the specific approaches used to select eigenvectors, using a
  relatively small number of eigenvectors may be insufficient to control
  phylogenetic autocorrelation, leading to flawed conclusions about patterns
  and processes. The method that minimizes residual autocorrelation seems to be
  the best choice according to different criteria. Thus, our analyses show
  that, when the best criterion is used to control phylogenetic structure, PVR
  can be a valuable tool for testing hypotheses related to heritability at the
  species level, phylogenetic niche conservatism and correlated evolution
  between ecological traits. -� 2011 The Authors. Ecography -� 2012 Nordic

    Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually
  in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive
  ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it
  inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to
  the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model.
  Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one
  region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown
  structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of
  collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ
  between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across
  disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have
  been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based
  pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and
  regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response
  relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we
  compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and
  machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by
  testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested
  whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in
  a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on
  a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically
  designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based
  models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based
  pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with
  penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when
  omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all
  approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity
  structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between
  predictor variables of |r| >0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when
  collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent
  prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis
  variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical
  approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve
  them. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In order to understand the ecological effects of climate change it is
  essential to forecast suitable areas for species in the future. However,
  species' ability to reach potentially suitable areas is also critical for
  species survival. These ‘range-shift' abilities can be studied using
  life-history traits related to four range-shift stages: emigration, movement,
  establishment, and proliferation. Here, we use the extent to which species'
  ranges fill the climatically suitable area available (‘range filling') as a
  proxy for the ability of European mammals and birds to shift their ranges
  under climate change. We detect which traits associate most closely with
  range filling. Drawing comparisons with a recent analysis for plants, we ask
  whether the latitudinal position of species' ranges supports the assertion
  that post-glacial range-shift limitations cause disequilibrium between ranges
  and climate. We also disentangle which of the three taxonomic groups has
  greatest range filling. For mammals, generalists and early-reproducing
  species have the greatest range filling. For birds, generalist species with
  high annual fecundity, which live longer than expected based on body size,
  have the greatest range filling. Although we consider traits related to the
  four range-shift stages, only traits related to establishment and
  proliferation ability significantly influence range filling of mammals and
  birds. Species with the greatest range filling are those whose range centroid
  falls in the latitudinal centre of Europe, suggesting that post-glacial range
  expansion is a leading cause of disequilibrium with climate, although other
  explanations are also possible. Range filling of plants is lower than that of
  mammals or birds, suggesting that plants are more range-limited by
  non-climatic factors. Therefore, plants might be face greater non-climatic
  restraints on range shifts than mammals or birds.%

    Invertebrates are dominant species in primary tropical rainforests, where
  their abundance and diversity contributes to the functioning and resilience
  of these globally important ecosystems. However, more than one-third of
  tropical forests have been logged, with dramatic impacts on rainforest
  biodiversity that may disrupt key ecosystem processes. We find that the
  contribution of invertebrates to three ecosystem processes operating at three
  trophic levels (litter decomposition, seed predation and removal, and
  invertebrate predation) is reduced by up to one-half following logging. These
  changes are associated with decreased abundance of key functional groups of
  termites, ants, beetles and earthworms, and an increase in the abundance of
  small mammals, amphibians and insectivorous birds in logged relative to
  primary forest. Our results suggest that ecosystem processes themselves have
  considerable resilience to logging, but the consistent decline of
  invertebrate functional importance is indicative of a human-induced shift in
  how these ecological processes operate in tropical rainforests.%

    Land use intensification can greatly reduce species richness and ecosystem
  functioning. However, species richness determines ecosystem functioning
  through the diversity and values of traits of species present. Here, we
  analyze changes in species richness and functional diversity (FD) at varying
  agricultural land use intensity levels. We test hypotheses of FD responses to
  land use intensification in plant, bird, and mammal communities using trait
  data compiled for 1600+ species. To isolate changes in FD from changes in
  species richness we compare the FD of communities to the null expectations of
  FD values. In over one-quarter of the bird and mammal communities impacted by
  agriculture, declines in FD were steeper than predicted by species number. In
  plant communities, changes in FD were indistinguishable from changes in
  species richness. Land use intensification can reduce the functional
  diversity of animal communities beyond changes in species richness alone,
  potentially imperiling provisioning of ecosystem services.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    How closely does variability in ecologically important traits reflect
  evolutionary divergence? The use of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to predict
  biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning, and more generally the use of
  phylogenetic information in community ecology, depends in part on the answer
  to this question. However, comparisons of the predictive power of
  phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity (FD) have not been conducted
  across a range of experiments. To address how phylogenetic diversity and
  functional trait variation control biodiversity effects on biomass
  production, we summarized the results of 29 grassland plant experiments where
  both the phylogeny of plant species used in the experiments is well described
  and where extensive trait data are available. Functional trait variation was
  only partially related to phylogenetic distances between species, and the
  resulting FD values therefore correlate only partially with PD. Despite these
  differences, FD and PD predicted biodiversity effects across all experiments
  with similar strength, including in subsets that excluded plots with legumes
  and that focused on fertilization experiments. Two- and three- trait
  combinations of the five traits used here (leaf nitrogen percentage, height,
  specific root length, leaf mass per unit area, and nitrogen fixation)
  resulted in the FD values with the greatest predictive power. Both PD and FD
  can be valuable predictors of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem
  functioning, which suggests that a focus on both community trait diversity
  and evolutionary history can improve understanding of the consequences of
  biodiversity loss.%

    Land use has generally been considered a local environmental issue, but it
  is becoming a force of global importance. Worldwide changes to forests,

  pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades,
  accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption,

    Summary Land-use change frequently reduces local species diversity. Species
  losses will often result in loss of trait diversity, with likely consequences
  for community functioning. However, the converse need not be generally true:
  management approaches that succeed in retaining species richness could
  nevertheless fail to maintain trait diversity. We evaluated this possibility
  using bee communities in a California agroecosystem. We examined among site
  patterns in bee species diversity and functional-trait diversity in a
  landscape composed of a mosaic of semi-natural habitat, organic farms and
  conventional farms. We sampled bees from all three habitat types and compiled
  a data base of life-history (‘functional’) traits for each species.
  Although species richness was higher on organic farms than conventional
  farms, functional diversity was lower in both farm types than in natural
  habitat. Nesting location (below-ground vs. above-ground) was the primary
  trait contributing to differences in functional diversity between farms and
  natural habitat, reflecting observed differences in availability of nesting
  substrates among habitat types. Other traits, including phenology and
  sociality, were also associated with species' occurrences or dominance in
  particular site types. These patterns suggest that management practices
  common to all farms act as environmental filters that cause similarly low
  functional diversity in their bee communities. Synthesis and applications.
  Although our results support the value of organic farming in maintaining
  abundant and species-rich bee communities, components of bee functional
  diversity are not well supported in farmed landscapes, regardless of farming
  practice. Maintenance of natural habitat, and/or the addition of natural
  habitat elements to farms, is therefore important for the retention of
  functionally diverse bee assemblages in agroecosystems.%

    Abstract Working in the context of the linear model y = X? + $\epsilon$, we
  generalize the concept of variance inflation as a measure of collinearity to
  a subset of parameters in ? (denoted by ? 1, with the associated columns of X
  given by X 1). The essential idea underlying this generalization is to
  examine the impact on the precision of estimation?in particular, the size of
  an ellipsoidal joint confidence region for ? 1?of less-than-optimal selection
  of other columns of the design matrix (X 2), treating still other columns (X
  0) as unalterable, even hypothetically. In typical applications, X 1 contains
  a set of dummy regressors coding categories of a qualitative variable or a
  set of polynomial regressors in a quantitative variable; X 2 contains all
  other regressors in the model, save the constant, which is in X 0. If
  $\sigma$ 2 V denotes the realized variance of , and $\sigma$ 2 U is the
  variance associated with an optimal selection of X 2, then the corresponding
  scaled dispersion ellipsoids to be compared are ? v = {x : x?V ?1 x ≤ 1}
  and ? U = {x : x?U ?1 x ≤ 1}, where ? U is contained in ? v . The two
  ellipsoids can be compared by considering the radii of ? v relative to ? U ,
  obtained through the spectral decomposition of V relative to U. We proceed to
  explore the geometry of generalized variance inflation, to show the
  relationship of these measures to correlation-matrix determinants and
  canonical correlations, to consider X matrices structured by relations of
  marginality among regressor subspaces, to develop the relationship of
  generalized variance inflation to hypothesis tests in the multivariate normal
  linear model, and to present several examples. Working in the context of the

    Whereas previous studies have investigated correlates of extinction risk
  either at global or regional scales, our study explicitly models regional
  effects of anthropogenic threats and biological traits across the globe.
  Using phylogenetic comparative methods with a newly-updated supertree of 5020
  extant mammals, we investigate the impact of species traits on extinction
  risk within each WWF ecoregion. Our analyses reveal strong geographical
  variation in the influence of traits on risk: notably, larger species are at
  higher risk only in tropical regions. We then relate these patterns to
  current and recent-historical human impacts across ecoregions usin g spatial
  modelling. The body-mass results apparently reflect historical declines of
  large species outside the tropics due to large-scale land conversion.
  Narrow-ranged and rare species tend to be at high risk in areas of high
  current human impacts. The interactions we describe between biological traits
  and anthropogenic threats increase understanding of the processes determining
  extinction risk.%

    Diet is a key trait of an organism's life history that influences a broad
  spectrum of ecological and evolutionary processes. Kissling et al. (2014;
  Ecology and Evolution 4: 2913–2930) compiled a species-specific data set of
  diet preferences of mammals for 38% of a total of 5364 terrestrial mammalian
  species assessed for the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red
  List, to facilitate future studies. The authors imputed dietary data for the
  remaining 62% by using extrapolation from phylogenetic relatives. We
  collected dietary information for 1261 mammalian species for which data were
  extrapolated by Kissling et al. (2014), in order to evaluate the success with
  which such extrapolation can predict true diets. The extrapolation method
  devised by Kissling et al. (2014) performed well for broad dietary categories
  (consumers of plants and animals). However, the method performed
  inconsistently, and sometimes poorly, for finer dietary categories, varying
  in accuracy in both dietary categories and mammalian orders. The results of
  the extrapolation performance serve as a cautionary tale. Given the large
  variation in extrapolation performance, we recommend a more conservative
  approach for inferring mammalian diets, whereby dietary extrapolation is
  implemented only when there is a high degree of phylogenetic conservatism for
  dietary traits. Phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to detect and
  measure phylogenetic signal in diet. If data for species are needed, then
  only the broadest feeding categories should be used. This would ensure a
  greater level of accuracy and provide a more robust data set for further
  ecological and evolutionary analysis.%

    Anthropogenic degradation of the world's ecosystems is leading to a
  widespread and accelerating loss of biodiversity. However, not all species
  respond equally to existing threats, raising the question: what makes a
  species more vulnerable to extinction? We propose that higher intraspecific
  variability may reduce the risk of extinction, as different individuals and
  populations within a species may respond differently to occurring threats.
  Supporting this prediction, our results show that mammalian species with more
  variable adult body masses, litter sizes, sexual maturity ages and population
  densities are less vulnerable to extinction. Our findings reveal the role of
  local variation among populations, particularly of large mammals, as a
  buffering mechanism against extinction, and emphasise the importance of
  considering trait variation in comparative analyses and conservation
  management.%

    1. Comparative analyses are used to address the key question of what makes
  a species more prone to extinction by exploring the links between
  vulnerability and intrinsic species' traits and/or extrinsic factors. This
  approach requires comprehensive species data but information is rarely
  available for all species of interest. As a result comparative analyses often
  rely on subsets of relatively few species that are assumed to be
  representative samples of the overall studied group. 2. Our study challenges
  this assumption and quantifies the taxonomic, spatial, and data type biases
  associated with the quantity of data available for 5415 mammalian species
  using the freely available life-history database PanTHERIA. 3. Moreover, we
  explore how existing biases influence results of comparative analyses of
  extinction risk by using subsets of data that attempt to correct for detected
  biases. In particular, we focus on links between four species' traits
  commonly linked to vulnerability (distribution range area, adult body mass,
  population density and gestation length) and conduct univariate and
  multivariate analyses to understand how biases affect model predictions. 4.
  Our results show important biases in data availability with c.22% of mammals
  completely lacking data. Missing data, which appear to be not missing at
  random, occur frequently in all traits (14-99% of cases missing). Data
  availability is explained by intrinsic traits, with larger mammals occupying
  bigger range areas being the best studied. Importantly, we find that existing
  biases affect the results of comparative analyses by overestimating the risk
  of extinction and changing which traits are identified as important
  predictors. 5. Our results raise concerns over our ability to draw general
  conclusions regarding what makes a species more prone to extinction. Missing
  data represent a prevalent problem in comparative analyses, and
  unfortunately, because data are not missing at random, conventional
  approaches to fill data gaps, are not valid or present important challenges.
  These results show the importance of making appropriate inferences from
  comparative analyses by focusing on the subset of species for which data are
  available. Ultimately, addressing the data bias problem requires greater
  investment in data collection and dissemination, as well as the development
  of methodological approaches to effectively correct existing biases.%

    Understanding what makes some species more vulnerable to extinction than
  others is an important challenge for conservation. Many comparative analyses
  have addressed this issue exploring how intrinsic and extrinsic traits
  associate with general estimates of vulnerability. However, these general
  estimates do not consider the actual threats that drive species to extinction
  and hence, are more difficult to translate into effective management. We
  provide an updated description of the types and spatial distribution of
  threats that affect mammals globally using data from the IUCN for 5941
  species of mammals. Using these data we explore the links between intrinsic
  species traits and specific threats in order to identify key intrinsic
  features associated with particular drivers of extinction. We find that
  families formed by small-size habitat specialists are more likely to be
  threatened by habitat-modifying processes; whereas, families formed by larger
  mammals with small litter sizes are more likely to be threatened by processes
  that directly affect survival. These results highlight the importance of
  considering the actual threatening process in comparative studies. We also
  discuss the need to standardize and rank threat importance in global
  assessments such as the IUCN Red List to improve our ability to understand
  what makes some species more vulnerable to extinction than others.%

    There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize
  the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have
  been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize
  the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs,
  pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the
  ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative
  method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to
  find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is,
  however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs
  to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more
  functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better
  ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply
  readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable
  metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster
  a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first
  distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource
  extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and
  the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then
  discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as
  niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the
  negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both
  exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most
  of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on
  food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic
  representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore,
  conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians
  and empiricists.%

    It is generally expected that landscape changes, such as habitat loss and
  fragmentation, should negatively affect functional diversity metrics, which
  in turn impact ecosystem functioning. In this review, we search for studies
  conducted in the tropics and published in the last 10 years to understand
  howdifferent aspects of landscape change affect functional diversity metrics
  and howthe latter are associated to ecosystem functioning. In total, we found
  24 papers that assessed the effects of landscape metrics on functional
  diversity, evenness, divergence and composition, and although there was a
  general trend for functional diversity metrics to improve with habitat cover,
  we found a wide range of responses. Most surprisingly, however, we only found
  five studies from the tropics assessing the extent to which functional
  diversity metrics were correlated to measures of ecosystem functioning, and
  in general, very weak support was found. In conclusion, our results show that
  it is crucial to first investigate the level towhich functional diversity
  metrics truly represent ormay lead to changes in ecosystemfunctioning, and
  this is particularly important for animal communities in the tropics.Without
  such confirmation, there is little reason to pursue further work to reach a
  consensus regarding how landscape modification affects functional diversity
  metrics.%

    At eight European field sites, the impact of loss of plant diversity on
  primary productivity was simulated by synthesizing grassland communities with
  different numbers of plant species. Results differed in detail at each
  location, but there was an overall log-linear reduction of average
  aboveground biomass with loss of species. For a given number of species,
  communities with fewer functional groups were less productive. These
  diversity effects occurred along with differences associated with species
  composition and geographic location. Niche complementarity and positive
  species interactions appear to play a role in generating
  diversity-productivity relationships within sites in addition to sampling
  from the species pool.%

    Genomic data are rapidly resolving the tree of living species calibrated to
  time, the timetree of life, which will provide a framework for research in
  diverse fields of science. Previous analyses of taxonomically restricted
  timetrees have found a decline in the rate of diversification in many groups
  of organisms, often attributed to ecological interactions among species.
  Here, we have synthesized a global timetree of life from 2,274 studies
  representing 50,632 species and examined the pattern and rate of
  diversification as well as the timing of speciation. We found that species
  diversity has been mostly expanding overall and in many smaller groups of
  species, and that the rate of diversification in eukaryotes has been mostly
  constant. We also identified, and avoided, potential biases that may have
  influenced previous analyses of diversification including low levels of taxon
  sampling, small clade size, and the inclusion of stem branches in clade
  analyses. We found consistency in time-to-speciation among plants and
  animals, ∼2 My, as measured by intervals of crown and stem species times.
  Together, this clock-like change at different levels suggests that speciation
  and diversification are processes dominated by random events and that
  adaptive change is largely a separate process.%

    Species richness and total abundance are two of the most commonly used
  response measures in empirical studies of the effects of anthropogenic
  land-use on biodiversity, in spite of the fact that they are insensitive to
  changes in a range of community attributes. We evaluated the extent to which
  meta-analyses about the effects of forest land-use on ecological communities
  make use of gross species richness, diversity and abundance measures
  (hereafter low-informative measures) as opposed to more refined response
  variables conveying a higher degree of conservation-relevant information,
  e.g., by accounting for compositional or functional changes in the
  communities (high-informative measures). Nearly one-half of the 221 included
  meta-analyses were based solely on low-informative measures. The prevalence
  of low-informative measures was higher for meta-analyses belonging to studies
  encompassing a broad taxonomic scope and it has increased since 2002. Few
  differences were detected in the use of response measures among taxonomic
  groups, although there were indications that some better-known groups tended
  to be more often studied with high-informative measures. To provide guidance
  for future work, we synthesized the high-informative measures of biodiversity
  used in the reviewed studies. For better-informed meta-analyses, we encourage
  the use of more refined approaches to quantify impacts on communities in
  addition to species richness and total abundance measures. This may involve,
  for example, the use of $\beta$ diversity and functional diversity measures,
  as well as separate analyses for different ecological groups or conservation
  status categories.%

    Understanding the responses of biodiversity to drivers of change and the
  effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties and ecosystem services is a
  key challenge in the context of global environmental change. We performed a
  systematic review and meta- analysis of the scientific literature linking
  direct drivers of change and ecosystem services via functional traits of
  three taxonomic groups (vegetation, invertebrates, and vertebrates) to: (1)
  uncover trends and research biases in this field; and (2) synthesize existing
  empirical evidence. Our results show the existence of important biases in
  published studies related to ecosystem types, taxonomic groups, direct
  drivers of change, ecosystem services, geographical range, and the spatial
  scale of analysis. We found multiple evidence of links between drivers and
  services mediated by functional traits, particularly between land- use
  changes and regulating services in vegetation and invertebrates. Seventy-
  five functional traits were recorded in our sample. However, few of these
  functional traits were repeatedly found to be associated with both the
  species responses to direct drivers of change (response traits) and the
  species effects on the provision of ecosystem services (effect traits). Our
  results highlight the existence of potential “key functional traits,”
  understood as those that have the capacity to influence the provision of
  multiple ecosystem services, while responding to specific drivers of change,
  across a variety of systems and organisms. Identifying “key functional
  traits” would help to develop robust indicator systems to monitor changes
  in biodiversity and their effects on ecosystem functioning and ecosystem
  services supply.%

    The ecosystem services (ES) framework was developed to articulate and
  measure the benefits humans receive from ecosystems. Cultural ecosystem
  services (CES), usually defined as the intangible and nonmaterial benefits
  ecosystems provide, have been relatively neglected by researchers and
  policy-makers compared to provisioning, supporting, and regulating services.
  Although valuing CES poses several conceptual and methodological
  difficulties, it is of huge interest and importance because of the linkages
  between cultural values, valuation methods, and the individual and collective
  decision-making that influence ecosystems and human wellbeing. This review is
  not a how-to guide, but rather examines key conceptual issues and maps
  critical areas of debate. There is a range of potential approaches to
  assessing CES; however, choices regarding valuation methods and their role in
  decision-making are shaped by cultural and political dynamics. CES are at a
  crossroads. They can potentially act as a fruitful conceptual container for a
  broad range of interdisciplinary research into human-environment relations
  and transform how decisions regarding the environment are made, but they can
  also be used to legitimize and entrench modes of decision-making that
  marginalize and undermine the very values they are intended to protect.%

    Ecosystems provide essential services for human society, which include
  provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Amphibians
  provide provisioning services by serving as a food source for some human
  societies, especially in Southeast Asia. They also serve as models in medical
  research and provide potential for new pharmaceuticals such as analgesics and
  anti-viral drugs derived from skin secretions. Amphibians contribute to
  regulating services by reducing mosquito recruitment from ephemeral wetlands,
  potentially controlling other pest species, and indirectly through predation
  of insect pollinators. Often neglected, ecosystems also provide cultural
  services to human societies that increase the quality of human life through
  recreation, religion, spirituality, and aesthetics. As an abundant and
  diverse class of vertebrates, amphibians also play prominent roles in the
  culture of human societies through pathways such as mythology, literature,
  and art. Most research on the role of amphibians in ecosystems has been on
  their contribution to supporting services. This is also the area where
  amphibians are likely to have the largest contribution to ecosystem services.
  Supporting services have structural (e.g., habitat) and functional (e.g.,
  ecosystem functions and processes) components. Amphibians can affect
  ecosystem structure through soil burrowing and aquatic bioturbation and
  ecosystem functions such as decomposition and nutrient cycling through waste
  excretion and indirectly through predatory changes in the food web. They also
  can control primary production in aquatic ecosystems through direct
  consumption and nutrient cycling. Unfortunately, amphibians are experiencing
  major declines and humans may be losing associated ecosystem services. It is
  important to understand how declines affect ecosystem services for human
  societies, but these declines can also serve as natural experiments to
  understand the role of amphibians in ecosystems.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a
  variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species
  extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components
  of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons,
  but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the
  goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments,
  observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties
  depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of
  organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of
  those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the
  effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in
  influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the
  above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The
  scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the
  relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many
  points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require
  integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem
  properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving
  species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and
  management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with
  understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management
  practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to
  minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management
  of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review
  of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions:
  1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem
  properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts,
  including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological
  engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation,
  mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a
  good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even
  relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence
  pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems
  via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered
  ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these
  changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with
  technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in
  composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can
  differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential
  community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to
  species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out
  similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little
  to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by
  abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a
  stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal
  variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and
  larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following
  conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their
  patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and
  nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence
  the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification
  of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex
  communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic
  species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar
  environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species
  richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure,
  disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence
  invasion success and often override effects of species richness in
  comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of
  species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can
  stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation
  in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms
  of different functional effect and functional response types will help
  preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further
  research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the
  relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community
  structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2)
  Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied
  in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem
  properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much
  more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity
  of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced
  experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments
  to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental
  perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of
  disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for
  several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity
  both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the
  feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental
  communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of
  extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global
  change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem
  properties for the development of effective management and conservation
  strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some
  coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and
  theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described
  here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is
  necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances
  under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating
  diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in
  making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing
  those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct,
  such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and
  mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future
  management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to
  communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a
  perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.%

    Evidence is mounting that extinctions are altering key processes important
  to the productivity and sustainability of Earth's ecosystems. Further species
  loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes, but it is unclear how
  these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental
  change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function.
  Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the
  effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition--two processes
  important in all ecosystems--are of comparable magnitude to the effects of
  many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels
  of species loss (21-40%) reduced plant production by 5-10%, comparable to
  previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming.
  Higher levels of extinction (41-60%) had effects rivalling those of ozone,
  acidification, elevated CO(2) and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels,
  species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did
  elevated CO(2) and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a
  large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide
  range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies
  on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our
  analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss
  are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global
  change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and
  remediation efforts.%

    Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are increasingly using big-data
  approaches to tackle questions at large spatial, taxonomic, and temporal
  scales. However, despite recent efforts to gather two centuries of
  biodiversity inventories into comprehensive databases, many crucial research
  questions remain unanswered. Here, we update the concept of knowledge
  shortfalls and review the tradeoffs between generality and uncertainty. We
  present seven key shortfalls of current biodiversity data. Four previously
  proposed shortfalls pinpoint knowledge gaps for species taxonomy (Linnean),
  distribution (Wallacean), abundance (Prestonian), and evolutionary patterns
  (Darwinian). We also redefine the Hutchinsonian shortfall to apply to the
  abiotic tolerances of species and propose new shortfalls relating to limited
  knowledge of species traits (Raunkiaeran) and biotic interactions (Eltonian).
  We conclude with a general framework for the combined impacts and
  consequences of shortfalls of large-scale biodiversity knowledge ...%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Biodiversity continues to decline in the face of increasing anthropogenic
  pressures such as habitat destruction, exploitation, pollution and
  introduction of alien species. Existing global databases of species' threat
  status or population time series are dominated by charismatic species. The
  collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and biogeographic extents, and
  that support computation of a range of biodiversity indicators, is necessary
  to enable better understanding of historical declines and to project – and
  avert – future declines. We describe and assess a new database of more than
  1.6 million samples from 78 countries representing over 28,000 species,
  collated from existing spatial comparisons of local-scale biodiversity
  exposed to different intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from
  terrestrial sites around the world. The database contains measurements taken
  in 208 (of 814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity
  hotspots and 16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more
  than 1% of the total number of all species described, and more than 1% of the
  described species within many taxonomic groups – including flowering
  plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles,
  lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added to,
  is therefore already considerably larger and more representative than those
  used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends and responses.
  The database is being assembled as part of the PREDICTS project (Projecting
  Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems –
  www.predicts.org.uk). We make site-level summary data available alongside
  this article. The full database will be publicly available in 2015.%

    Abstract Aim Globally, urbanization is one of the most widespread, intense
  and ecologically destructive forms of landscape transformation, and it is
  often concentrated in coastal areas. Theoretically, species losses
  attributable to urbanization are predicted not to alter overall ecosystem
  function if functional redundancy (i.e. replacement of function by
  alternative species) compensates for such losses. Here, we test this
  expectation by measuring how coastal urbanization affects scavenger guilds on
  sandy beaches and whether changes in guild composition result either in an
  overall loss of scavenging efficiency, or in functional compensation under
  alternative guild structures, maintaining net ecosystem functioning. Location
  Fourteen beaches along the east coast of Australia with variable levels of
  urbanization. Methods Scavenging communities and rates of carrion removal
  were determined using motion-triggered cameras at the beach-dune interface.
  Results A substantial shift in the community structure of vertebrate
  scavengers was associated with gradients in urbanization. Iconic and
  functionally important raptors declined precipitously in abundance on urban
  beaches. Importantly, other vertebrates usually associated with urban
  settings (e.g. dogs, foxes, corvids) did not functionally replace raptors. In
  areas where < 15\% of the abutting land had been developed into urban areas,
  carcass removal by scavengers was often complete, but always > 70\%.
  Conversely, on beaches bordering coastal cities with < 40\% of natural
  vegetation remaining, two-thirds of fish carcasses remained uneaten by
  scavengers. Raptors removed 70–100\% of all deployed fish carcasses from
  beaches with < 8\% urban land cover, but this number dropped significantly
  with greater levels of urbanization and was not compensated by other
  scavenger species in urban settings. Main conclusions There is limited
  functional redundancy in vertebrate scavenger communities of sandy beach
  ecosystems, which impacts the system's capacity to mitigate the ecological
  consequences of detrimental landscape transformations.%

    Recent research has demonstrated how scavenging, the act of consuming dead
  animals, plays a key role in ecosystem structure, functioning, and stability.
  A growing number of studies suggest that vertebrate scavengers also provide
  key ecosystem services, the benefits humans gain from the natural world,
  particularly in the removal of carcasses from the environment. An increasing
  proportion of the human population is now residing in cities and towns, many
  of which, despite being highly altered environments, contain significant
  wildlife populations, and so animal carcasses. Indeed, non-predation
  fatalities may be higher within urban than natural environments. Despite
  this, the fate of carcasses in urban environments and the role vertebrate
  scavengers play in their removal have not been determined. In this study, we
  quantify the role of vertebrate scavengers in urban environments in three
  towns in the UK. Using experimentally deployed rat carcasses and rapid fire
  motion-triggered cameras, we determined which species were scavenging and how
  removal of carcass biomass was partitioned between them. Of the 63
  experimental carcasses deployed, vertebrate scavenger activity was detected
  at 67%. There was a significantly greater depletion in carcass biomass in the
  presence (mean loss of 194 g) than absence (mean loss of 14 g) of scavengers.
  Scavenger activity was restricted to three species, Carrion crows Corvus
  corone, Eurasian magpies Pica pica, and European red foxes Vulpes vulpes.
  From behavioral analysis, we estimated that a maximum of 73% of the carcass
  biomass was removed by vertebrate scavengers. Despite having low species
  richness, the urban scavenger community in our urban study system removed a
  similar proportion of carcasses to those reported in more pristine
  environments. Vertebrate scavengers are providing a key urban ecosystem
  service in terms of carcass removal. This service is, however, often
  overlooked, and the species that provide it are among some of the most
  disliked and persecuted.%

    Species numbers are increasing rapidly. This is due mostly to taxonomic
  inflation, where known subspecies are raised to species as a result in a
  change in species concept, rather than to new discoveries. Yet
  macroecologists and conservation biologists depend heavily on species lists,
  treating them as accurate and stable measures of biodiversity. Deciding on a
  standardized, universal species list might ameliorate the mismatch between
  taxonomy and the uses to which it is put. However, taxonomic uncertainty is
  ultimately due to the evolutionary nature of species, and is unlikely to be
  solved completely by standardization. For the moment, at least, users must
  acknowledge the limitations of taxonomic species and avoid unrealistic
  expectations of species lists.%

    Biodiversity loss decreases ecosystem functioning at the local scales at
  which species interact, but it remains unclear how biodiversity loss affects
  ecosystem functioning at the larger scales of space and time that are most
  relevant to biodiversity conservation and policy. Theory predicts that
  addi-tional insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning could
  emerge across time and space if species respond asynchronously to
  environmental variation and if species become increas-ingly dominant when and
  where they are most productive. Even if only a few dominant species maintain
  ecosystem functioning within a particular time and place, ecosystem
  functioning may be enhanced by many different species across many times and
  places (b-diversity). Here, we develop and apply a new approach to estimate
  these previously unquantified insurance effects of biodiver-sity on ecosystem
  functioning that arise due to species turnover across times and places. In a
  long-term (18-year) grassland plant diversity experiment, we find that total
  insurance effects are positive in sign and substantial in magnitude,
  amounting to 19% of the net biodiversity effect, mostly due to temporal
  insurance effects. Species loss can therefore reduce ecosystem functioning
  both locally and by eliminating species that would otherwise enhance
  ecosystem functioning across temporally fluctuating and spatially
  heterogeneous environments.%

    Aim: To understand how climatic conditions influence the geographical
  distributions of species and their potential responses to climate change, we
  investigated the relationships between the thermal tolerances of species and
  the size and limits of their distributions. We tested two hypotheses for
  endotherms: the climatic variability hypothesis, which predicts increases in
  range size with increasing breadth of thermal tolerance, and the climatic
  extreme hypothesis, which predicts that range limits are related to thermal
  tolerance limits. Furthermore, we tested whether these relationships differ
  between temperate and tropical areas. Location: Global. Time period: Present.
  Major taxa studied: Birds and mammals. Methods: We compiled data on thermal
  tolerances that had been measured in physiological experiments for 453
  endothermic species, along with information on geographical ranges and
  climatic conditions. We applied phylogenetic generalized least square
  regressions to test for relationships between thermal tolerance and (a) range
  size or limits and (b) breadth and extremes of the climatic conditions that
  each species experiences across its distribution. Results: We found that
  range size was not related to the breadth thermal tolerance for endotherms.
  However, the range limits at high latitudes as well as the minimum
  temperatures experienced by species were closely related to the physiological
  cold tolerances of species. These relationships were particularly strong in
  temperate regions, but these patterns were not found in the tropics. Main
  conclusions: Our results are inconsistent with the predictions of the
  climatic variability hypothesis, but are in line with the predictions of the
  climatic extreme hypothesis. Furthermore, the factors determining species
  distributions do not appear to be the same in tropical and temperate regions.
  Our study emphasizes the need to combine spatially explicit distribution
  models with information from physiological experiments in order to capture
  regional differences and improve predictions of the responses of species to
  climate change.%

    Ecological trait data are essential for understanding the broad-scale
  distribution of biodiversity and its response to global change. For animals,
  diet represents a fundamental aspect of species' evolutionary adaptations,
  ecological and functional roles, and trophic interactions. However, the
  importance of diet for macroevolutionary and macroecological dynamics remains
  little explored, partly because of the lack of comprehensive trait datasets.
  We compiled and evaluated a comprehensive global dataset of diet preferences
  of mammals ("MammalDIET"). Diet information was digitized from two global and
  cladewide data sources and errors of data entry by multiple data recorders
  were assessed. We then developed a hierarchical extrapolation procedure to
  fill-in diet information for species with missing information. Missing data
  were extrapolated with information from other taxonomic levels (genus, other
  species within the same genus, or family) and this extrapolation was
  subsequently validated both internally (with a jack-knife approach applied to
  the compiled species-level diet data) and externally (using independent
  species-level diet information from a comprehensive continentwide data
  source). Finally, we grouped mammal species into trophic levels and dietary
  guilds, and their species richness as well as their proportion of total
  richness were mapped at a global scale for those diet categories with good
  validation results. The success rate of correctly digitizing data was 94%,
  indicating that the consistency in data entry among multiple recorders was
  high. Data sources provided species-level diet information for a total of
  2033 species (38% of all 5364 terrestrial mammal species, based on the IUCN
  taxonomy). For the remaining 3331 species, diet information was mostly
  extrapolated from genus-level diet information (48% of all terrestrial mammal
  species), and only rarely from other species within the same genus (6%) or
  from family level (8%). Internal and external validation showed that: (1)
  extrapolations were most reliable for primary food items; (2) several diet
  categories ("Animal", "Mammal", "Invertebrate", "Plant", "Seed", "Fruit", and
  "Leaf") had high proportions of correctly predicted diet ranks; and (3) the
  potential of correctly extrapolating specific diet categories varied both
  within and among clades. Global maps of species richness and proportion
  showed congruence among trophic levels, but also substantial discrepancies
  between dietary guilds. MammalDIET provides a comprehensive, unique and
  freely available dataset on diet preferences for all terrestrial mammals
  worldwide. It enables broad-scale analyses for specific trophic levels and
  dietary guilds, and a first assessment of trait conservatism in mammalian
  diet preferences at a global scale. The digitalization, extrapolation and
  validation procedures could be transferable to other trait data and taxa.%

    Summary There is a growing interest amongst community ecologists in
  functional traits. Response traits determine membership in communities.
  Effect traits influence ecosystem function. One goal of community ecology is
  to predict the effect of environmental change on ecosystem function.
  Environmental change can directly and indirectly affect ecosystem function.
  Indirect effects are mediated through shifts in community structure. It is
  difficult to predict how environmental change will affect ecosystem function
  via the indirect route when the change in effect trait distribution is not
  predictable from the change in response trait distribution. When response
  traits function as effect traits, however, it becomes possible to predict the
  indirect effect of environmental change on ecosystem function. Here we
  illustrate four examples in which key attributes of ectomycorrhizal fungi
  function as both response and effect traits. While plant ecologists have
  discussed response and effect traits in the context of community structuring
  and ecosystem function, this approach has not been applied to ectomycorrhizal
  fungi. This is unfortunate because of the large effects of ectomycorrhizal
  fungi on ecosystem function. We hope to stimulate further research in this

    Aim Urbanization broadly affects the phylogenetic and functional diversity
  of natural communities through a variety of processes including habitat loss
  and the introduction of non-native species. Due to the challenge of acquiring
  direct measurements, these effects have been studied primarily using
  “space-for-time” substitution where spatial urbanization gradients are
  used to infer the consequences of urbanization occurring across time. The
  ability of alternative sampling designs to replicate the findings derived
  using space-for-time substitution has not been tested. Location Global.
  Methods We contrasted the phylogenetic and functional diversity of breeding
  bird assemblages in 58 cities worldwide with the corresponding regional
  breeding bird assemblages estimated using geographic range maps. Results
  Compared to regional assemblages, urban assemblages contained lower
  phylogenetic diversity, lower phylogenetic beta diversity, a reduction in the
  least evolutionary distinct species and the loss of the most evolutionarily
  distinct species. We found no evidence that these effects were related to the
  presence of non-native species. Urban assemblages contained fewer aquatic
  species and fewer aquatic foraging species. The distribution of body size and
  range size narrowed for urban assemblages with the loss of species at both
  tails of the distribution, especially large bodied and broadly distributed
  species. Urban assemblages contained a greater proportion of species
  classified as passerines, doves or pigeons; species identified as granivores;
  species that forage within vegetation or in the air; and species with more
  generalized associations with foraging strata. Main conclusions Urbanization
  is associated with the overall reduction and constriction of phylogenetic and
  functional diversity, results that largely replicate those generated using
  space-for-time substitution, increasing our confidence in the quality of the
  combined inferences. When direct measurements are unavailable, our findings
  emphasize the value of developing independent sampling methods that broaden
  and reinforce our understanding of the ecological implications of
  urbanization.%

    The use of functional traits to describe community structure is a promising
  approach to reveal generalities across organisms and ecosystems. Plant
  ecologists have demonstrated the importance of traits in explaining community
  structure, competitive interactions as well as ecosystem functioning. The
  application of trait-based methods to more complex communities such as food
  webs is however more challenging owing to the diversity of animal
  characteristics and of interactions. The objective of this study was to
  determine how functional structure is related to food web structure. We
  consider that food web structure is the result of 1) the match between
  consumer and resource traits, which determine the occurence of a trophic
  interaction between them, and 2) the distribution of functional traits in the
  community. We implemented a statistical approach to assess whether or not 35
  466 pairwise interactions between soil organisms are constrained by
  trait-matching and then used a Procrustes analysis to investigate
  correlations between functional indices and network properties across 48
  sites. We found that the occurrence of trophic interactions is well predicted
  by matching the traits of the resource with those of the consumer. Taxonomy
  and body mass of both species were the most important traits for the
  determination of an interaction. As a consequence, functional evenness and
  the variance of certain traits in the community were correlated to trophic
  complementarity between species, while trait identity, more than diversity,
  was related to network topology. The analysis was however limited by trait
  data availability, and a coarse resolution of certain taxonomic groups in our
  dataset. These limitations explain the importance of taxonomy, as well as the
  complexity of the statistical model needed. Our results outline the important
  implications of trait composition on ecological networks, opening promising
  avenues of research into the relationship between functional diversity and
  ecosystem functioning in multi-trophic systems. This article is protected by

    A new framework for measuring functional diversity (FD) from multiple
  traits has recently been proposed. This framework was mostly limited to
  quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there
  are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to
  extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is
  to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible
  distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in
  multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any
  number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative,
  semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing
  trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new
  multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is
  closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue
  of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are
  species relative abundances. For unweighted presence–absence data, FDis can
  be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the
  ‘‘FD'' R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD
  framework.%

    Abstract By causing extinctions and altering community structure,
  anthropogenic disturbances can disrupt processes that maintain ecosystem
  integrity. However, the relationship between community structure and
  ecosystem functioning in natural systems is poorly understood. Here we show
  that habitat loss appeared to disrupt ecosystem functioning by affecting
  extinction order, species richness and abundance. We studied pollination by
  bees in a mosaic of agricultural and natural habitats in California and dung
  burial by dung beetles on recently created islands in Venezuela. We found
  that large-bodied bee and beetle species tended to be both most
  extinction-prone and most functionally efficient, contributing to rapid
  functional loss. Simulations confirmed that extinction order led to greater
  disruption of function than predicted by random species loss. Total abundance
  declined with richness and also appeared to contribute to loss of function.
  We demonstrate conceptually and empirically how the non-random response of
  communities to disturbance can have unexpectedly large functional
  consequences.%

    Ecological investigations are increasingly using functional diversity in
  order to understand different patterns, such as species occurrence, species
  competitive abilities, and the influence of biological communities on
  ecosystem functioning. Here we provide an overview of the history and
  applicability of functional diversity in ecological studies. We found that
  the idea of functional diversity emerged many times and in distinct fields
  over the years. Functional diversity was conceived as an alternative
  classification to measure the ecological importance of species in a
  community, as well as a way to understand how biodiversity affects specific
  ecosystem functions. Gradually, new questions regarding functional traits
  emerged. Some examples include understanding species competitive abilities,
  patterns of species co-occurrence, community assembly, and the role of
  different traits on ecosystem functioning. The increasing use of
  functional-based approaches fueled the search for new metrics aiming at
  accurately estimating functional diversity and, consequently,
  categorical-based classifications of functional traits have been gradually
  replaced by continuous multi-trait approaches. More recently, the role of
  functional diversity was recognized as a key factor to maintain important
  functions and services of ecosystems. We present empirical evidence
  supporting this statement.%

    1. The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be
  grouped accord- ing to common responses to the environment and/or common
  effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships
  between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental
  factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that
  determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as
  biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2.
  We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology,
  ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem
  func- tioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental
  filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with
  appropriate responses, result in assem- blages with varying trait
  composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which
  relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by
  different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily
  deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3. To illustrate this framework we
  analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While
  traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped
  with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was
  found between response to fire and flammability. 4. We hypothesize that these
  patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be
  determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling,
  because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between
  acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic
  traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have
  little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be
  of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5. This framework is likely to be
  broadly applicable, although caution must be exer- cised to use trait
  linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental con- ditions
  and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional
  types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of
  experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem
  properties.%

    The importance of biodiversity for the integrated functioning of ecosystems
  remains unclear because most evidence comes from analyses of biodiversity's
  effect on individual functions. Here we show that the effects of biodiversity
  on ecosystem function become more important as more functions are considered.
  We present the first systematic investigation of biodiversity's effect on
  ecosystem multifunctionality across multiple taxa, trophic levels and
  habitats using a comprehensive database of 94 manipulations of species
  richness. We show that species-rich communities maintained multiple functions
  at higher levels than depauperate ones. These effects were stronger for
  herbivore biodiversity than for plant biodiversity, and were remarkably
  consistent across aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Despite observed
  tradeoffs, the overall effect of biodiversity on multifunctionality grew
  stronger as more functions were considered. These results indicate that prior
  research has under-estimated the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem
  functioning by focusing on individual functions and taxonomic groups.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Functional richness, currently defined as the amount of niche space
  occupied by the species within a community, is one of the three major
  components of functional diversity. Different indices have been developed in
  order to quantify this component. However, the range of indices available for
  assessing functional richness, often mathematically complex and based on
  different rationales, can cause confusion for field ecologists and lead to
  misinterpretation of the results obtained. In this context, we have provided
  the first study exclusively focused on the comparison of the definitions,
  advantages and drawbacks of a large set of functional richness indices. The
  first part of this work is focused on four indices (FDP&G, FRic, TOP and
  N-hypervolumes indices) that are currently the most commonly used for
  assessing functional richness. We have completed our study by including
  recently developed indices that enable us to take into account the
  intraspecific trait variability (i.e. FRim index and TDP framework), because
  there is currently a growing scientific consensus regarding the necessity of
  including this aspect in the assessment of the functional diversity of
  communities. We demonstrate that although authors have argued that their
  index describes the functional richness, each of them describes only part of
  it, and this part may strongly differ from one index to another. Rather than
  advocating the general use of a single index and/or systematically avoiding
  others, our study highlights the need for selecting indices in close relation
  with the context, the available data and the aims of each study. Such a
  strategy is an essential preliminary step for preventing misunderstanding and
  artefactual controversies. Along these lines, we propose some guidelines to
  help users in selecting the most appropriate indices according both to the
  facet of functional richness on which they wish to focus and to the
  characteristics of the available data.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Top-order predators often have positive effects on biological diversity
  owing to their key functional roles in regulating trophic cascades and other
  ecological processes. Their loss has been identified as a major factor
  contributing to the decline of biodiversity in both aquatic and terrestrial
  systems. Consequently, restoring and maintaining the ecological function of
  top predators is a critical global imperative. Here we review studies of the
  ecological effects of the dingo Canis lupus dingo, Australia's largest land
  predator, using this as a case study to explore the influence of a top
  predator on biodiversity at a continental scale. The dingo was introduced to
  Australia by people at least 3500 years ago and has an ambiguous status owing
  to its brief history on the continent, its adverse impacts on livestock
  production and its role as an ecosystem architect. A large body of research
  now indicates that dingoes regulate ecological cascades, particularly in arid
  Australia, and that the removal of dingoes results in an increase in the
  abundances and impacts of herbivores and invasive mesopredators, most notably
  the red fox Vulpes vulpes. The loss of dingoes has been linked to widespread
  losses of small and medium-sized native mammals, the depletion of plant
  biomass due to the effects of irrupting herbivore populations and increased
  predation rates by red foxes. We outline a suite of conceptual models to
  describe the effects of dingoes on vertebrate populations across different
  Australian environments. Finally, we discuss key issues that require
  consideration or warrant research before the ecological effects of dingoes
  can be incorporated formally into biodiversity conservation programs.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The theory of "top-down" ecological regulation predicts that herbivory
  suppresses plant abundance, biomass, and survival but increases diversity
  through the disproportionate consumption of dominant species, which inhibits
  competitive exclusion. To date, these outcomes have been clear in aquatic
  ecosystems but not on land. We explicate this discrepancy using a
  meta-analysis of experimental results from 123 native animal exclusions in
  natural terrestrial ecosystems (623 pairwise comparisons). Consistent with
  top-down predictions, we found that herbivores significantly reduced plant
  abundance, biomass, survival, and reproduction (all P < 0.01) and increased
  species evenness but not richness (P = 0.06 and P = 0.59, respectively).
  However, when examining patterns in the strength of top-down effects, with
  few exceptions, we were unable to detect significantly different effect sizes
  among biomes, based on local site characteristics (climate or productivity)
  or study characteristics (study duration or exclosure size). The positive
  effects on diversity were only significant in studies excluding large animals
  or located in temperate grasslands. The results demonstrate that top-down
  regulation by herbivores is a pervasive process shaping terrestrial plant
  communities at the global scale, but its strength is highly site specific and
  not predicted by basic site conditions. We suggest that including herbivore
  densities as a covariate in future exclosure studies will facilitate the
  discovery of unresolved macroecology trends in the strength of
  herbivore-plant interactions.%

    1. Examining the consequences of environmental change for the provision of
  ecosystem services can be facilitated through trait-based frameworks that
  consider linkages between traits that influence a species' response to change
  and traits that determine its effect on ecosystem services. 2. Developing
  these frameworks requires a systematic approach to trait selection and
  addressing the interrelationships among the scale of the environmental
  change, area of ecosystem service provision and the most appropriate traits
  for analysis. 3. We examine key issues in the application of trait approaches
  to vertebrates, drawing specifically on the substantial progress made in this
  area for plants. We argue that vertebrate ecologists need to develop more
  coherent and systematic trait-based approaches that are broadly applicable.
  4. We present a new framework for selecting response and effect traits to
  link environmental change with ecosystem services. An empirical example of
  each step in the framework is provided using birds as a case study, linking
  the environmental change of loss of tree cover with the ecosystem service of
  invertebrate pest regulation in apple orchards. We found that as tree cover
  around orchards increased so did the abundance and foraging rate of bird
  species that pursue invertebrates in flight, and this may help reduce the
  abundance of certain pests of apples (e.g. adult stages of Cydia pomonella
  and Helicoverpa armigera). 5. Implementing a systematic and transparent
  approach to trait selection should further refine the development of
  trait-based approaches for vertebrates.%

    Examinations of the impact of land-use change on functional diversity link
  changes in ecological community structure driven by land modification with
  the consequences for ecosystem function. Yet, most studies have been
  small-scale, experimental analyses and primarily focussed on plants. There is
  a lack of research on fauna communities and at large-scales across multiple
  land uses. We assessed changes in the functional diversity of bird
  communities across 24 land uses aligned along an intensification gradient. We
  tested the hypothesis that functional diversity is higher in less intensively
  used landscapes, documented changes in diversity using four diversity
  metrics, and examined how functional diversity varied with species richness
  to identify levels of functional redundancy. Functional diversity, measured
  using a dendogram-based metric, increased from high to low intensity land
  uses, but observed values did not differ significantly from
  randomly-generated expected values. Values for functional evenness and
  functional divergence did not vary consistently with land-use
  intensification, although higher than expected values were mostly recorded in
  high intensity land uses. A total of 16 land uses had lower than expected
  values for functional dispersion and these were mostly low intensity native
  vegetation sites. Relations between functional diversity and bird species
  richness yielded strikingly different patterns for the entire bird community
  vs. particular functional groups. For all birds and insectivores, functional
  evenness, divergence and dispersion showed a linear decline with increasing
  species richness suggesting substantial functional redundancy across
  communities. However, for nectarivores, frugivores and carnivores, there was
  a significant hump-shaped or non-significant positive linear relationship
  between these functional measures and species richness indicating less
  redundancy. Hump-shaped relationships signify that the most functionally
  diverse communities occur at intermediate levels of species richness.
  Interpretations of redundancy thus vary for different functional groups and
  related ecosystem functions (e.g. pollination), and can be substantially
  different to relationships involving entire ecological communities.%

    Whilst agreeing with the analysis of the article, I would urge a word of
  caution about any putting actions to slow climate change onto the back
  burner. Firstly, climate change due to CO2 emissions is the ultimate
  "supertanker" impact - it takes almost forever to reverse its impact once
  released. Secondly, climate change is placing unprecedented ecological, and
  evolutionary stress on the thermal niche dimension of almost every species on
  the planet, with unknown and essentially unpredictable secondary impacts
  arising from differential ecological responses of previously inter-linked
  species - aka plants and pollinators. Time to knuckle down at the coal face

    In the conservation literature on land-use change, it is often assumed that
  land-use intensification drives species loss, driving a loss of functional
  trait diversity and ecosystem function. Modern research, however, does not
  support this cascade of loss for all natural systems. In this paper we
  explore the errors in this assumption and present a conceptual model taking a
  more mechanistic approach to the species–functional trait association in a
  context of land-use change. We provide empirical support for our model's
  predictions demonstrating that the association of species and functional
  trait diversity follows various trajectories in response to land-use change.
  The central premise of our model is that land-use change impacts upon
  processes of community assembly, not species per se. From the model, it is
  clear that community context (i.e. type of disturbance, species pool size)
  will affect the response trajectory of the relationship between species and
  functional trait diversity in communities undergoing land-use change. The
  maintenance of ecosystem function and of species diversity in the face of
  increasing land-use change are complementary goals. The use of a more
  ecologically realistic model of responses of species and functional traits
  will improve our ability to make wise management decisions to achieve both
  aims in specific at-risk systems.%

    Model predictions of extinction risks from anthropogenic climate change are
  dire, but still overly simplistic. To reliably predict at-risk species we
  need to know which species are currently responding, which are not, and what
  traits are mediating the responses. For mammals, we have yet to identify
  overarching physiological, behavioral, or biogeographic traits determining
  species' responses to climate change, but they must exist. To date, 73 mammal
  species in North America and eight additional species worldwide have been
  assessed for responses to climate change, including local extirpations, range
  contractions and shifts, decreased abundance, phenological shifts,
  morphological or genetic changes. Only 52% of those species have responded as
  expected, 7% responded opposite to expectations, and the remaining 41% have
  not responded. Which mammals are and are not responding to climate change is
  mediated predominantly by body size and activity times (phylogenetic
  multivariate logistic regressions, P < 0.0001). Large mammals respond more,
  for example, an elk is 27 times more likely to respond to climate change than
  a shrew. Obligate diurnal and nocturnal mammals are more than twice as likely
  to respond as mammals with flexible activity times (P < 0.0001). Among the
  other traits examined, species with higher latitudinal and elevational ranges
  were more likely to respond to climate change in some analyses, whereas
  hibernation, heterothermy, burrowing, nesting, and study location did not
  influence responses. These results indicate that some mammal species can
  behaviorally escape climate change whereas others cannot, analogous to
  paleontology's climate sheltering hypothesis. Including body size and
  activity flexibility traits into future extinction risk forecasts should
  substantially improve their predictive utility for conservation and
  management.%

    A growing understanding of the ecology of seed dispersal has so far had
  little influence on conservation practice, while the needs of conservation
  practice have had little influence on seed dispersal research. Yet seed
  dispersal interacts decisively with the major drivers of biodiversity change
  in the 21st century: habitat fragmentation, overharvesting, biological
  invasions, and climate change. We synthesize current knowledge of the effects
  these drivers have on seed dispersal to identify research gaps and to show
  how this information can be used to improve conservation management. The
  drivers, either individually, or in combination, have changed the quantity,
  species composition, and spatial pattern of dispersed seeds in the majority
  of ecosystems worldwide, with inevitable consequences for species survival in
  a rapidly changing world. The natural history of seed dispersal is now
  well-understood in a range of landscapes worldwide. Only a few
  generalizations that have emerged are directly applicable to conservation
  management, however, because they are frequently confounded by site-specific
  and species-specific variation. Potentially synergistic interactions between
  disturbances are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts, but these are
  rarely investigated. We recommend that the conservation status of
  functionally unique dispersers be revised and that the conservation target
  for key seed dispersers should be a population size that maintains their
  ecological function, rather than merely the minimum viable population. Based
  on our analysis of conservation needs, seed dispersal research should be
  carried out at larger spatial scales in heterogenous landscapes, examining
  the simultaneous impacts of multiple drivers on community-wide seed dispersal
  networks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.%

    There is considerable debate about whether community ecology will ever

  should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a
  two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits
  within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the
  interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized

    The capacity of species to track shifting climates into the future will
  strongly influence outcomes for biodiversity under a rapidly changing
  climate. However, we know remarkably little about the dispersal abilities of
  most species and how these may be influenced by climate change. Here we show
  that climate change is projected to substantially reduce the seed dispersal
  services provided by frugivorous vertebrates in rainforests across the
  Australian Wet Tropics. Our model projections show reductions in both median
  and long-distance seed dispersal, which may markedly reduce the capacity of
  many rainforest plant species to track shifts in suitable habitat under
  climate change. However, our analyses suggest that active management to
  maintain the abundances of a small set of important frugivores under climate
  change could markedly reduce the projected loss of seed dispersal services
  and facilitate shifting distributions of rainforest plant species.%

    Phylogenetic imputation has recently emerged as a potentially powerful tool
  for predicting missing data in functional traits datasets. As such,
  understanding the limitations of phylogenetic modelling in predicting trait
  values is critical if we are to use them in subsequent analyses. Previous
  studies have focused on the relationship between phylogenetic signal and
  clade-level prediction accuracy, yet variability in prediction accuracy among
  individual tips of phylogenies remains largely unexplored. Here, we used
  simulations of trait evolution along the branches of phylogenetic trees to
  show how the accuracy of phylogenetic imputations is influenced by the
  combined effects of (1) the amount of phylogenetic signal in the traits and
  (2) the branch length of the tips to be imputed. Specifically, we conducted
  cross-validation trials to estimate the variability in prediction accuracy
  among individual tips on the phylogenies (hereafter “tip-level
  accuracy”). We found that under a Brownian motion model of evolution (BM,
  Pagel's $\lambda$ = 1), tip-level accuracy rapidly decreased with increasing
  tip branch-lengths, and only tips of approximately 10% or less of the total
  height of the trees showed consistently accurate predictions (i.e.
  cross-validation R-squared > 0.75). When phylogenetic signal was weak, the
  effect of tip branch-length was reduced, becoming negligible for traits
  simulated with $\lambda$ < 0.7, where accuracy was in any case low. Our study
  shows that variability in prediction accuracy among individual tips of the
  phylogeny should be considered when evaluating the reliability of
  phylogenetically imputed trait values. To address this challenge, we describe
  a Monte Carlo-based method that allows one to estimate the expected tip-level
  accuracy of phylogenetic predictions for continuous traits. Our approach
  identifies gaps in functional trait datasets for which phylogenetic
  imputation performs poorly, and will help ecologists to design more efficient
  trait collection campaigns by focusing resources on lineages whose trait
  values are more uncertain. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

    When tropical systems lose species, they are often assumed to be buffered

  richness gradient in global fish faunas on tropical reefs encompassing 6,316
  species distributed among 646 functional entities (FEs): i.e., unique
  combinations of functional traits. We found that the highest functional
  redundancy is located in the Central Indo-Pacific with a mean of 7.9 species
  per FE. However, this overall level of redundancy is disproportionately
  packed into few FEs, a pattern termed functional over-redundancy (FOR). For
  instance, the most speciose FE in the Central Indo-Pacific contains 222
  species (out of 3,689) whereas 38% of FEs (180 out of 468) have no functional
  insurance with only one species. Surprisingly, the level of FOR is consistent
  across the six fish faunas, meaning that, whatever the richness, over a third
  of the species may still be in overrepresented FEs whereas more than one
  third of the FEs are left without insurance, these levels all being
  significantly higher than expected by chance. Thus, our study shows that,
  even in high-diversity systems, such as tropical reefs, functional diversity
  remains highly vulnerable to species loss. Although further investigations
  are needed to specifically address the influence of redundant vs. vulnerable
  FEs on ecosystem functioning, our results suggest that the promised benefits
  from tropical biodiversity may not be as strong as previously thought.%

    1.Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each
  other more than species drawn at random from the same tree. This pattern is
  of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research
  areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it.
  Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and
  guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2.Here, we
  compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data.
  Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along
  phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated
  the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution
  of tree structure and the availability of branch length information,
  examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the
  associated statistical tests. 3.We found that under a Brownian motion (BM)
  model of trait evolution, Abouheif's Cmean and Pagel's $\lambda$ performed
  well and substantially better than Moran's I and Blomberg's K. Pagel's
  $\lambda$ provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for
  discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was
  computationally more demanding than Abouheif's Cmean. Blomberg's K was most
  suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation
  experiments. 4.Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty
  but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing
  branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5.We propose
  guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to
  true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a
  quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different
  topologies of phylogenies. 6.These guidelines aim to better assess
  phylogenetic signal and distinguish it from random trait distributions. They
  were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with
  more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree
  generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when
  requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that
  explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific
  clades.%

    Studying life-history traits within and across taxonomic classifications
  has revealed many interesting and important patterns, but this approach to
  life history requires access to large compilations of data containing many
  different life-history parameters. Currently, life-history data for amniotes

  available databases, data tables embedded in individual papers and books, and
  species-specific studies by experts. Using data from this wide range of

  lack of standardization in taxonomic classifications, parameter values, and
  even in which parameters are reported. In order to facilitate comparative

    COMMUNITIES of species and their associated biological, chemical and
  physical processes, collectively known as ecosystems, drive the Earth's
  biogeochemical processes(1,2). Currently most ecosystems are experiencing
  loss of biodiversity associated with the activities of human expansion(3-5),
  raising the issue of whether the biogeochemical functioning of ecosystems
  will be impaired by this loss of species(6-8). Current ecological knowledge
  supports a wide range of views on the subject(9-13), but empirical tests are
  few(9,14-16). Here we provide evidence from direct experimental manipulation
  of diversity by over an order of magnitude, using multi-trophic level
  communities and simultaneous measures of several ecosystem processes, that
  reduced biodiversity may indeed alter the performance of ecosystems.%

    Land-use change is one of the main drivers of current and likely future
  biodiversity loss. Therefore, understanding how species are affected by it is
  crucial to guide conservation decisions. Species respond differently to
  land-use change, possibly related to their traits. Using pan-tropical data on
  bird occurrence and abundance across a human land-use intensity gradient, we
  tested the effects of seven traits on observed responses. A likelihood-based
  approach allowed us to quantify uncertainty in modelled responses, essential
  for applying the model to project future change. Compared with undisturbed
  habitats, the average probability of occurrence of bird species was 7.8 per
  cent and 31.4 per cent lower, and abundance declined by 3.7 per cent and 19.2
  per cent in habitats with low and high human land-use intensity,
  respectively. Five of the seven traits tested affected the observed responses
  significantly: long-lived, large, non-migratory, primarily frugivorous or
  insectivorous forest specialists were both less likely to occur and less
  abundant in more intensively used habitats than short-lived, small,
  migratory, non-frugivorous/insectivorous habitat generalists. The finding
  that species responses to land use depend on their traits is important for
  understanding ecosystem functioning, because species' traits determine their
  contribution to ecosystem processes. Furthermore, the loss of species with
  particular traits might have implications for the delivery of ecosystem
  services.%

    Habitat oss continues to cause loss of biodiversity. To quantify the
  effects of land-use change on the diversity and composition of ecological
  communities – in terms of functional groups – we makemodelled estimates
  of the impact of past and future (to 2050) land-use change on the overall
  diversity and dietary guild structure of tropical forest bird communities.
  Location Tropical and subtropical forests (40° S to 40° N). Methods Using a
  likelihood-based model, we project the impact of land-use intensity on the
  diversity and functional structure of tropical forest bird commu- nities,
  including an estimation of uncertainty. To explore the extent to which
  predicted impacts are determined by the inherent sensitivity of communities
  because of the traits possessed by the species present, we quantify
  communities in terms of trait composition and explore relationships between
  trait composition and diversity/guild loss. Results We estimate that habitat
  loss has led to an average decrease of 4% in total abundance, but with marked
  differences across different guilds, leading to substan- tial changes in
  community composition: an 11.4% loss of frugivores, 7.8% loss of nectarivores
  and 7.3% loss of insectivores, and a 4.0% gain of other herbivores. Projected
  land-use change is predicted to result in average future losses of 1% of
  total abundance, 1% of each of frugivores, nectarivores and insectivores, but
  no average change in the abundance of other herbivores. Past and future
  changes have varied substantially across the biome, owing to variation in
  land-use change and in the initial trait composition of communities. Main
  conclusions We predict that marked changes in community structure have
  occurred in the past and will occur in the future, with disproportionate
  losses of frugivores, nectarivores and insectivores compared with other
  species; these species are known to provide important ecosystem services. In
  the past, SouthAmerica has been particularly strongly affected,while
  Southeast Asia will experience the strong- est impacts in the future%

    Human activities, especially conversion and degradation of habitats, are
  causing global biodiversity declines. How local ecological assemblages are
  responding is less clear—a concern given their importance for many
  ecosystem functions and services.We analysed a terrestrial assemblage
  database of unprecedented geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local
  biodiversity responses to land use and related changes. Here we show that in
  the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reducewithin-sample species
  richness by anaverage of 76.5%,total abundance by 39.5%andrarefaction-based
  richness by 40.3%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already
  slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6%), total abundance
  (10.7%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1%), with changes showing marked
  spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a
  business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to
  fall by a further 3.4% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in
  biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strongmitigationcan

    Human use of the land (for agriculture and settlements) has a substantial
  negative effect on biodiversity globally. However, not all species are
  adversely affected by land use, and indeed, some benefit from the creation of
  novel habitat. Geographically rare species may be more negatively affected by
  land use than widespread species, but data limitations have so far prevented
  global multi-clade assessments of land-use effects on narrow-ranged and
  widespread species. We analyse a large, global database to show consistent
  differences in assemblage composition. Compared with natural habitat,
  assemblages in disturbed habitats have more widespread species on average,
  especially in urban areas and the tropics. All else being equal, this result
  means that human land use is homogenizing assemblage composition across
  space. Disturbed habitats show both reduced abundances of narrow-ranged
  species and increased abundances of widespread species. Our results are very
  important for biodiversity conservation because narrow-ranged species are
  typically at higher risk of extinction than widespread species. Furthermore,
  the shift to more widespread species may also affect ecosystem functioning by
  reducing both the contribution of rare species and the diversity of species'
  responses to environmental changes among local assemblages.%

    Biodiversity continues to decline under the effect of multiple human
  pressures. We give a brief overview of the main pressures on biodiversity,
  before focusing on the two that have a predominant effect: land-use and
  climate change. We discuss how interactions between land-use and climate
  change in terrestrial systems are likely to have greater impacts than
  expected when only considering these pressures in isolation. Understanding
  biodiversity changes is complicated by the fact that such changes are likely
  to be uneven among different geographic regions and species. We review the
  evidence for variation in terrestrial biodiversity changes, relating
  differences among species to key ecological characteristics, and explaining
  how disproportionate impacts on certain species are leading to a spatial
  homogenisation of ecological communities. Finally, we explain how the overall
  losses and homogenisation of biodiversity, and the larger impacts upon
  certain types of species, are likely to lead to strong negative consequences
  for the functioning of ecosystems, and consequently for human
  well-being.IPBES, Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem

    Aim Islands are thought to promote correlated ecological and life-history
  shifts in species, including increased population density, and an infrequent
  production of few, large, offspring. These patterns are collectively termed
  ‘the island syndrome'. We present here the first, phylogenetically
  informed, global test of the ‘island syndrome' hypothesis, using lizards as
  our model organisms. Location World-wide. Methods We assembled a database
  containing 641 lizard species, their phylogenetic relationships, geographic
  ranges and the following life-history traits: female mass, clutch size, brood
  frequency, hatchling body mass and population density. We tested for
  life-history differences between insular and mainland forms in light of the
  island syndrome, controlling for mass and latitude, and for phylogenetic
  non-independence. We also examined the effects of population density and, in
  insular endemics, of island area, on lizard reproductive traits. Results We
  found that insular endemic lizards lay smaller clutches of larger hatchlings
  than closely related mainland lizards of similar size, as was expected by the
  island syndrome. In general, however, insular endemics lay more frequently
  than mainland ones. Species endemic to small islands lay as frequently as
  mainland species. Continental and insular lizards have similar productivity
  rates overall. Island area had little effect on lizard reproductive traits.
  No trait showed association with population density. Main conclusions Island
  endemic lizards mainly follow the island syndrome. We hypothesize that large
  offspring are favoured on islands because of increased intra-specific
  aggression and cannibalism by adults. Stable populations on islands lacking
  predators may likewise lead to increased intra-specific competition, and
  hence select for larger hatchlings that will quickly grow to adult size. This
  view is supported by the fact that lizard populations are denser on islands
  – although population density per se was uncorrelated with any of the
  traits we examined%

    Aim The species population density–range size relationship posits that
  locally abundant species are widely distributed. However, this proposed
  pattern has been insufficiently tested. The few tests conducted were usually
  limited in scale and gave conflicting results. We tested the generality of
  the positive population density–range size relationship. We then studied
  whether similar environmental niche requirements are correlated with range
  size and with population density to search for mechanisms driving the
  hypothesized link between population density and range size. Location
  Worldwide. Methods We collected data on population density, range size and
  environmental niche for a global dataset of 192 lizard, 893 bird and 350
  mammal species. Assessing the relationship between population density and
  range size and environmental niche parameters, we corrected for phylogenetic
  relationships, body mass, diet and study area. Results Our findings reveal
  that density had a weak negative correlation with bird range size and was
  unrelated to lizard and mammal range size. These trends were consistent at
  the global scale and across the biogeographical realms. Range size was
  related to relatively similar environmental niche parameters in all groups.
  Population density, however, was explained by taxon-specific factors and was
  therefore unrelated to range size by common causation. Main conclusions We
  suggest that the positive relationship between population density and range
  size identified in previous studies might be an artefact arising through
  incomplete sampling of range sizes. Our results indicate that the mechanisms
  shaping population density and range size may be independent.%

    Aim: Habitat modification is causing widespread declines in biodiversity
  and the homogenization of biotas. Amphibians are especially threatened by
  habitat modification, yet we know little about why some species persist or
  thrive in the face of this threat whereas others decline. Our aim was to
  identify intrinsic factors that explain variation among amphibians in their
  sensitivity to habitat modification (SHM), factors that could help target
  groups of species for conservation. Location: Global. Time period:
  1986–2015 Major taxon studied: Amphibians. Methods: We quantified SHM using
  species abundances in natural and altered habitats as reported in published
  field surveys. We first examined associations between local SHM and
  range-wide threatened status, population trends and invasiveness. We then
  evaluated the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic variables in explaining
  species SHM using multiple comparative methods. Our analyses included over
  200 species that could be ranked with confidence from 47 studies across five
  continents. Results: Amphibians species varied considerably in local SHM.
  High SHM was associated with ele-vated range-wide extinction risk and
  declining population trends. Species that were tolerant of habitat
  modification were most likely to be invasive outside their native range.
  Geographical range size was the most important intrinsic predictor and was
  negatively associated with SHM. Larval habitat was also an important
  predictor, but was tightly coupled with phylogenetic position. Main
  conclusions: Narrowly distributed species whose larvae develop on land or in
  lotic habitats are most sensitive to habitat modification. However, other
  unmeasured, phylogenetically con-strained traits could underlie the effect of
  larval habitat. Species range size is frequently correlated with global
  extinction risk in vertebrates, and our analysis extends this macroecological
  pattern to the sensitivity of amphibians to local habitat loss, a proximate
  driver of extinction. These general patterns of SHM should help identify
  those groups of amphibians most at risk in an era of rapid habitat loss and
  scarce conservation resources.%

    Biotic homogenization, the gradual replacement of native biotas by locally
  expanding non-natives, is a global process that diminishes floral and faunal
  distinctions among regions. Although patterns of homogenization have been
  well studied, their specific ecological and evolutionary consequences remain
  unexplored. We argue that our current perspective on biotic homogenization
  should be expanded beyond a simple recognition of species diversity loss,
  towards a synthesis of higher order effects. Here, we explore three distinct
  forms of homogenization (genetic, taxonomic and functional), and discuss
  their immediate and future impacts on ecological and evolutionary processes.
  Our goal is to initiate future research that investigates the broader
  conservation implications of homogenization and to promote a proactive style
  of adaptive management that engages the human component of the anthropogenic
  blender that is currently mixing the biota on Earth.%

    Current ecological and evolutionary research are increasingly moving from
  species- to trait-based approaches because traits provide a stronger link to
  organism's function and fitness. Trait databases covering a large number of

  groups. Amphibians are among the most diverse vertebrate groups on Earth, and
  constitute an abundant component of major terrestrial and freshwater
  ecosystems. They are also facing rapid population declines worldwide, which
  is likely to affect trait composition in local communities, thereby impacting
  ecosystem processes and services. In this context, we introduce AmphiBIO, a
  comprehensive database of natural history traits for amphibians worldwide.
  The database releases information on 17 traits related to ecology, morphology
  and reproduction features of amphibians. We compiled data from more than
  1,500 literature sources, and for more than 6,500 species of all orders
  (Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona), 61 families and 531 genera. This database
  has the potential to allow unprecedented large-scale analyses in ecology,
  evolution, and conservation of amphibians.%

    Urban development is rapidly expanding across the globe and is a major
  driver of environmental change. Despite considerable improvements in our
  understanding of how species richness responds to urbanisation, there is
  still insufficient knowledge of how other measures of assemblage composition
  and structure respond to urban development. Functional diversity metrics
  provide a useful approach for quantifying ecological function. We compare
  avian functional diversity in 25 urban areas, located across the globe, with
  paired non-urban assemblages using a database of 27 functional traits that
  capture variation in resource use (amount and type of resources and how they
  are acquired) across the 529 species occurring across these assemblages.
  Using three standard functional diversity metrics (FD, MNTD and convex hull)
  we quantify observed functional diversity and, using standardized effect
  sizes, how this diverges from that expected under random community assembly
  null models. We use regression trees to investigate whether human population
  density, amount of vegetation and city size (spatial extent of urban land),
  bio-region and use of semi-natural or agricultural assemblages as a baseline
  modulate the effect of urbanisation on functional diversity. Our analyses
  suggest that observed functional diversity of urban avian assemblages is not
  consistently different from that of non-urban assemblages. After accounting
  for species richness avian functional diversity is higher in cities than
  areas of semi-natural habitat. This creates a paradox as species responses to
  urban development are determined by their ecological traits, which should
  generate assemblages clustered within a narrow range of trait space. Greater
  habitat diversity within cities compared to semi-natural areas dominated by a
  single habitat may enhance functional diversity in cities and explain this
  paradox. Regression trees further suggest that smaller urban areas, lower
  human population densities and increased vegetation all enhance the
  functional diversity of urban areas. A city's attributes can thus influence
  the functional diversity of its biological assemblages, and their associated
  ecological functions. This has important implications for the debate
  regarding how we should grow the world's cities whilst maintaining their
  ecological function.%

    Accelerating rates of environmental change and the continued loss of global
  biodiversity threaten functions and services delivered by ecosystems. Much
  ecosystem monitoring and management is focused on the provision of ecosystem
  functions and services under current environmental conditions, yet this could
  lead to inappropriate management guidance and undervaluation of the
  importance of biodiversity. The maintenance of ecosystem functions and
  services under substantial predicted future environmental change (i.e., their
  'resilience') is crucial. Here we identify a range of mechanisms underpinning
  the resilience of ecosystem functions across three ecological scales.
  Although potentially less important in the short term, biodiversity,
  encompassing variation from within species to across landscapes, may be
  crucial for the longer-term resilience of ecosystem functions and the
  services that they underpin.%

    Generation length (GL) is defined as the average age of parents of the
  current cohort, reflecting the turnover rate of breeding individuals in a
  population. GL is a fundamental piece of information for population ecology
  as well as for measuring species threat status (e.g. in the IUCN Red List).
  Here we present a dataset including GL records for all extant mammal species
  (n=5427). We first reviewed all data on GL published in the IUCN Red List
  database. We then calculated a value for species with available reproductive
  parameters (reproductive life span and age at first reproduction). We
  assigned to missing-data species a mean GL value from congeneric or
  confamilial species (depending on data availability). Finally, for a few
  remaining species, we assigned mean GL values from species with similar body
  mass and belonging to the same order. Our work provides the first attempt to
  complete a database of GL for mammals; it will be an essential reference
  point for all conservation-related studies that need pragmatic information on
  species GL, such as population dynamics and applications of the IUCN Red List
  assessment.%

    The effects of climate change on biodiversity are increasingly well
  documented, and many methods have been developed to assess species'
  vulnerability to climatic changes, both ongoing and projected in the coming
  decades. To minimize global biodiversity losses, conservationists need to
  identify those species that are likely to be most vulnerable to the impacts
  of climate change. In this Review, we summarize different currencies used for
  assessing species' climate change vulnerability. We describe three main
  approaches used to derive these currencies (correlative, mechanistic and
  trait-based), and their associated data requirements, spatial and temporal
  scales of application and modelling methods. We identify strengths and
  weaknesses of the approaches and highlight the sources of uncertainty
  inherent in each method that limit projection reliability. Finally, we
  provide guidance for conservation practitioners in selecting the most
  appropriate approach(es) for their planning needs and highlight priority
  areas for further assessments.%

    Although it is widely accepted that future climatic change—if
  unabated—is likely to have major impacts on biodiversity1, 2, few studies
  have attempted to quantify the number of species whose populations have
  already been impacted by climate change3, 4. Using a systematic review of
  published literature, we identified mammals and birds for which there is
  evidence that they have already been impacted by climate change. We modelled
  the relationships between observed responses and intrinsic (for example, body
  mass) and spatial traits (for example, temperature seasonality within the
  geographic range). Using this model, we estimated that 47% of terrestrial
  non-volant threatened mammals (out of 873 species) and 23.4% of threatened
  birds (out of 1,272 species) may have already been negatively impacted by
  climate change in at least part of their distribution. Our results suggest
  that populations of large numbers of threatened species are likely to be
  already affected by climate change, and that conservation managers, planners
  and policy makers must take this into account in efforts to safeguard the
  future of biodiversity.%

    The recruitment of seedlings from seeds is the key demographic transition
  for rain forest trees. Though tropical forest mammals are known to consume
  many seeds, their effects on tree community structure remain little known. To
  evaluate their effects, we monitored 8,000 seeds of 24 tree species using
  exclosure cages that were selectively permeable to three size classes of
  mammals for up to 4.4 years. Small and medium- bodied mammals removed many
  more seeds than did large mammals, and they alone generated beta diversity
  and negative density dependence, whereas all mammals reduced diversity and
  shaped local species composition. Thus, small and medium- bodied mammals more
  strongly contributed to community structure and promoted species coexistence
  than did large mammals. Given that seedling recruitment is seed limited for
  most species, alterations to the composition of the community of mammalian
  seed predators is expected to have long- term consequences for tree community
  structure in tropical forests.%

    In a recent paper, McLachlan et al. presented evidence that migration rates

  important insight for climate-change impacts studies and suggest that the

    There is an urgent need to develop effective vulnerability assessments for
  evaluating the conservation status of species in a changing climate1 .
  Several new assessment approaches have been proposed for evaluating the
  vulnerability of species to climate change2–5 based on the expectation that
  established assessments such as the IUCN Red List6 need revising or
  superseding in light of the threat that climate change brings. However,
  although previous studies have identified ecological andlife history
  attributes that characterize declining species or those listed as
  threatened7–9 , no study so far has undertaken a quantitative analysis of
  the attributes that cause species to be at high risk of extinction
  specifically due to climate change.We developed a simulation approach based
  on generic life history types to show here that extinction risk due to
  climate change can be predicted using a mixture of spatial and demographic
  variables that can be measured in the present day without the need for
  complex forecasting models. Most of the variableswe found to be important for
  predicting extinction risk, including occupied area and population size, are
  already used in species conservation assessments, indicating that present
  systems may be better able to identify species vulnerable to climate change
  than previously thought. Therefore, although climate change brings many
  newconservation challenges,we find that it may not be fundamentally different
  from other threats in terms of assessing extinction risks.%

    * Despite efforts in data collection, missing values are commonplace in
  life-history trait databases. Because these values typically are not missing
  randomly, the common practice of removing missing data not only reduces
  sample size, but also introduces bias that can lead to incorrect conclusions.
  Imputing missing values is a potential solution to this problem. Here, we
  evaluate the performance of four approaches for estimating missing values in
  trait databases (K-nearest neighbour (kNN), multivariate imputation by
  chained equations (mice), missForest and Phylopars), and test whether imputed
  datasets retain underlying allometric relationships among traits.\n\n*
  Starting with a nearly complete trait dataset on the mammalian order
  Carnivora (using four traits), we artificially removed values so that the
  percent of missing values ranged from 10% to 80%. Using the original values
  as a reference, we assessed imputation performance using normalized root mean
  squared error. We also evaluated whether including phylogenetic information
  improved imputation performance in kNN, mice, and missForest (it is a
  required input in Phylopars). Finally, we evaluated the extent to which the
  allometric relationship between two traits (body mass and longevity) was
  conserved for imputed datasets by looking at the difference (bias) between
  the slope of the original and the imputed datasets or datasets with missing
  values removed.\n\n* Three of the tested approaches (mice, missForest and
  Phylopars), resulted in qualitatively equivalent imputation performance, and
  all had significantly lower errors than kNN. Adding phylogenetic information
  into the imputation algorithms improved estimation of missing values for all
  tested traits. The allometric relationship between body mass and longevity
  was conserved when up to 60% of data were missing, either with or without
  phylogenetic information, depending on the approach. This relationship was
  less biased in imputed datasets compared to datasets with missing values
  removed, especially when more than 30% of values were missing.\n\n*
  Imputations provide valuable alternatives to removing missing observations in
  trait databases as they produce low errors and retain relationships among
  traits. Although we must continue to prioritize data collection on species
  traits, imputations can provide a valuable solution for conducting
  macroecological and evolutionary studies using life-history trait databases.%

    Functional diversity is an important component of biodiversity, yet in
  comparison to taxonomic diversity, methods of quantifying functional
  diversity are less well developed. Here, we propose a means for quantifying
  functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how
  functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of
  functional diversity ''FD'' is defined as the total branch length of a
  functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to
  other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional
  groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the
  relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the
  effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer
  dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional
  redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and
  decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases
  the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities
  show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.%

    Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns
  the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we
  review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of
  organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the
  two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional
  diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are
  distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into
  a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional
  diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests.
  There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a
  substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a
  particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims
  of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for
  assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work
  before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of
  measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four
  main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has
  significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that
  do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by
  summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the
  size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include
  information about species' abundances. We show some new and important
  differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses
  of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and
  analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between
  organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We
  suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations
  that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity.
  Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure
  functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being
  addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions
  for novel research.%

    We tested the hypotheses that species with greater mobility and/or higher
  reproductive rates are less sensitive to habitat loss than species with lower
  mobility and/or reproductive rates by conducting a meta-analysis of wetland
  vertebrate responses to wetland habitat loss. We combined data from 90
  studies conducted worldwide that quantified the relationship between wetland
  amount in a landscape and population abundance of at least one wetland
  species to determine if mobility (indexed as home range size and body length)
  and annual reproductive rate influence species responses to wetland loss.
  When analyzed across all taxa, animals with higher reproductive rates were
  less sensitive to wetland loss. Surprisingly, we did not find an effect of
  mobility on response to wetland loss. Overall, wetland mammals and birds were
  more sensitive to wetland loss than were reptiles and amphibians. Our results
  suggest that dispersal between habitat patches is less important than
  species' reproductive rates for population persistence in fragmented
  landscapes. This implies that immigration and colonization rate is most
  strongly related to reproduction, which determines the total number of
  potential colonists.%

    Aim Examining the biogeography of body size is crucial for understanding
  how animal communities are assembled and maintained. In tetrapods, body size
  varies predictably with temperature, moisture, productivity seasonality and
  topographical complexity. Although millennial-scale human pressures are known
  to have led to the extinction of primarily large-bodied tetrapods, human
  pressure history is often ignored in studies of body size that focus on
  extant species. Here, we analyse 11,377 tetrapod species of the Western
  Hemisphere to test whether millennial-scale human pressures have left an
  imprint on contemporary body mass distributions throughout the tetrapod
  clade. Location Western Hemisphere. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa
  studied Tetrapods (birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles). Methods We
  mapped the distribution of assemblage-level median tetrapod body mass at a
  resolution of 110 km across the Western Hemisphere. We then generated
  multivariate models of median body mass as a function of temperature,
  moisture, productivity seasonality and topographical complexity, as well as
  two variables capturing the history of human population density and
  human-induced land conversion over the past 12,000 years. We controlled for
  both spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelation effects on body
  mass–environment relationships. Results Human pressures explain a small but
  significant portion of geographical variation in median body mass that cannot
  be explained by ecological constraints alone. Overall, the median body mass
  of tetrapod assemblages is lower than expected in areas with a longer history
  of high human population density and land conversion, but there are important
  differences among tetrapod classes. Main conclusions At this broad scale, the
  effect of human pressure history on tetrapod body mass is low relative to
  that of ecology. However, ignoring spatial variation in the history of human
  pressure is likely to lead to bias in studies of the present-day functional
  composition of tetrapod assemblages, at least in areas that have long been
  influenced by humans.%

    Vertebrate pollinators are increasingly threatened worldwide, but little is
  known about the potential consequences of declining pollinator populations on
  plants and ecosystems. Here, we present the first global assessment of the
  importance of vertebrate pollinators in the reproductive success of selected
  flowering plants. Our meta-analysis of 126 experiments on animal-pollinated
  plants revealed that excluding vertebrate pollinators – but not insect
  pollinators – reduced fruit and/or seed production by 63% on average. We
  found bat-pollinated plants to be more dependent on their respective
  vertebrate pollinators than bird-pollinated plants (an average 83% reduction
  in fruit/seed production when bats were excluded, as compared to a 46%
  reduction when birds were excluded). Plant dependence on vertebrate
  pollinators for fruit/seed production was greater in the tropics than at
  higher latitudes. Given the potential for substantial negative impacts
  associated with the loss of vertebrate pollinators, there is a clear need for
  prompt, effective conservation action for threatened flower-visiting
  vertebrate species. Additional research on how such changes might affect
  wider ecosystems is also required.%

    Package contains various functions for phylogenetic analysis. This

  data from species. For example, the package includes functions for Bayesian
  and ML ancestral state estimation; visual simulation of trait evolution;
  fitting models of trait evolution with multiple Brownian rates and
  correlations; visualizing discrete and continuous character evolution using
  colors or projections into trait space; identifying the location of a change
  in the rate of character evolution on the tree; fast Brownian motion
  simulation and simulation under several other models of continuous trait
  evolution; fitting a model of correlated binary trait evolution; locating the
  position of a fossil or an recently extinct lineage on a tree using
  continuous character data with ML; plotting lineage accumulation through
  time, including across multiple trees (such as a Bayesian posterior sample);
  conducting an analysis called stochastic character mapping, in which
  character histories for a discrete trait are sampled from their posterior
  probability distribution under a model; conducting a multiple (i.e., partial)
  Mantel test; fitting a phylogenetic regression model with error in predictor
  and response variables; conducting a phylogenetic principal components
  analysis, a phylogenetic regression, a reduced major axis regression, a
  phylogenetic canonical correlation analysis, and a phylogenetic ANOVA;
  projecting a tree onto a geographic map; simulating discrete character
  histories on the tree; and fitting a model in which a discrete character
  evolves under the threshold model. In addition to this phylogenetic
  comparative method functionality, the package also contains functions for a
  wide range of other purposes in phylogenetic biology. For instance,
  functionality in this package includes (but is not restricted to): adding
  taxa to a tree (including randomly, everywhere, or automatically to genera);
  generating all bi- and multi-furcating trees for a set of taxa; reducing a
  phylogeny to its backbone tree; dropping tips or adding tips to special types
  of phylogenetic trees; exporting a tree as an XML file; converting a tree
  with a mapped character to a tree with singleton nodes and one character
  state per edge; estimating a phylogeny using the least squares method;
  simulating birth-death trees under a range of conditions; rerooting trees; a
  wide range of visualizations of trees; and a variety of other manipulations
  and analyses that phylogenetic biologists may find useful for their

    The preservation of ecosystem processes under ongoing biotic erosion
  requires that some species within affected communities perform similar
  functions, a property that is usually defined as functional redundancy.
  Although functional redundancy has recently become a relevant part of
  ecological research, so far there is no agreement on its measurement. The
  scope of this work is thus to propose a consistent framework based on
  functional dissimilarities among species for summarizing different facets of
  functional redundancy. The behaviour of the proposed measures is illustrated
  with one small artificial data set, together with actual examples on the
  species functional turnover along successional gradients. We believe this new
  framework provides an important contribution for the clarification and
  quantification of key metrics of community redundancy and vulnerability. The
  method, for which we provide a simple r function called ‘uniqueness',
  further allows summarizing the functional contribution of single species to
  the overall redundancy of any type of biological community.%

    Multiple studies have shown that biodiversity loss can impair ecosystem
  processes, providing a sound basis for the general application of a
  precautionary approach to managing biodiversity. However, mechanistic details
  of species loss effects and the generality of impacts across ecosystem types
  are poorly understood. The functional niche is a useful conceptual tool for
  understanding redundancy, where the functional niche is defined as the area
  occupied by a species in an n-dimensional functional space. Experiments to
  assess redundancy based on a single functional attribute are biased towards
  finding redundancy, because species are more likely to have non-overlapping
  functional niches in a multi-dimensional functional space. The effect of
  species loss in any particular ecosystem will depend on i) the range of
  function and diversity of species within a functional group, ii) the relative
  partitioning of variance in functional space between and within functional
  groups, and iii) the potential for functional compensation (degree of
  functional niche overlap) of the species within a functional group. Future
  research on functional impairment with species loss should focus on
  identifying which species, functional groups, and ecosystems are most
  vulnerable to functional impairment from species loss, so that these can be
  prioritized for management activities directed at maintaining ecosystem
  function. This will require a better understanding of how the organization of
  diversity into discrete functional groups differs between different
  communities and ecosystems.%

    Documenting and exploring the patterns of diversity of life on Earth has
  always been a central theme in biology. Species richness despite being the
  most commonly used measure of diversity in macroecological studies suffers
  from not considering the evolutionary and ecological differences among
  species. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD) have been
  proposed as alternative measures to overcome this limitation. Although
  species richness, PD and FD are closely related, their relationships have
  never been investigated on a global scale. Comparing PD and FD with species
  richness corroborated the general assumptions of surrogacy of the different
  diversity measures. However, the analysis of the residual variance suggested
  that the mismatches between the diversity measures are influenced by
  environmental conditions. PD increased relative to species richness with
  increasing mean annual temperature, whereas FD decreased with decreasing
  seasonality relative to PD. We also show that the tropical areas are
  characterized by a FD deficit, a phenomenon, that suggests that in tropical
  areas more species can be packed into the ecological space. We discuss
  potential mechanisms that could have resulted in the gradient of spatial
  mismatch observed in the different biodiversity measures and draw parallels
  to local scale studies. We conclude that the use of multiple diversity
  measures on a global scale can help to elucidate the relative importance of
  historical and ecological processes shaping the present gradients in
  mammalian diversity.%

    Quantifying the relative impacts of top-down vs. bottom-up control of
  ecosystems remains a controversial issue, with debate often focusing on the
  perennial question of how predators affect prey densities. To assess predator
  impacts, we performed a worldwide meta-analysis of field experiments in which
  the densities of terrestrial vertebrate predators were manipulated and the
  responses of their terrestrial vertebrate prey were measured. Our results
  show that predation indeed limits prey populations, as prey densities change
  substantially after predator manipulations. The main determinant of the
  result of an experiment was the efficiency of predator manipulation. Positive
  impacts of predator manipulation appeared to increase with duration of the
  experiment for non-cyclic prey, while the opposite was true for cyclic prey.
  In addition, predator manipulation showed a large positive impact on cyclic
  prey at low prey densities, but had no obvious impact at peak prey densities.
  As prey population densities generally respond predictably to predator
  manipula- tions, we suggest that control of introduced vertebrate predators
  can be used to effectively conserve and manage native wildlife. However, care
  should be taken when controlling native predators, especially apex species,
  owing to their importance as strong interactors and the biodiversity value of
  their habitats. We discuss gaps in our knowledge of predator–prey
  relationships and methodological issues related to manipulation experiments.
  An important guideline for future studies is that adequate monitoring of
  predator numbers before and during the experiment is the only way to ensure
  that observed responses in prey populations are actually caused by changes in
  predation impacts.%

    Aim Longevity is an important life-history trait, directly linked to the
  core attrib- utes of fitness (reproduction and survival), yet large-scale
  comparative studies quantifying its implications for the ecology and life
  history of ectotherms are scarce. We tested the allometry of longevity in
  squamates and the tuatara, and determined how longevity is related to key
  environmental characteristics and life- history traits. Predictions based on
  life-history theory are expected to hold true for ectotherms, similarly to
  mammals and birds. Location World-wide. Methods We assembled fromthe
  literature a dataset of the maximum longevities of more than a thousand
  squamate species, representing c. 10% of their known species diversity, their
  phylogenetic relationships and multiple life-history and ecological
  variables. Correcting for phylogeny, we modelled the link between squamate
  longevity and both key life-history traits, such as body mass and age at
  first reproduction, and important environmental factors, such as latitude and
  primary productivity within species distributional ranges. Results
  Large-bodied species live for longer than small ones, but body size explains
  far less of the variance in longevity than it does in mammals and birds.
  Accounting for body size, squamate brood frequency is negatively correlated
  with longevity, while age at first reproduction is positively correlatedwith
  longevity. This points to a continuum of slow-to-fast life-history
  strategies. Squamates in high latitudes and cold regions live for longer,
  probably because a shorter season of activity translates to slower
  development, older age at first reproduction and hence to increased
  longevity. Individuals live longer in captivity than in the wild. Her-
  bivorous and omnivorous squamates live for longer than carnivorous ones. We
  postulate that low-quality nutrition reduces growth rates, promotes a
  relative decline in reproductive rates and thus prolongs life. Main
  conclusions Our results support key predictions from life-history theory and
  suggest that reproducing more slowly and at older ages, being herbivorous
  and, plausibly, lowering metabolism, result in increased longevity.%

    Knowledge of mammalian diversity is still surprisingly disparate, both
  regionally and taxonomically. Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of
  the conservation status and distribution of the world's mammals. Data,
  compiled by 1700+ experts, cover all 5487 species, including marine mammals.
  Global macroecological patterns are very different for land and marine
  species but suggest common mechanisms driving diversity and endemism across
  systems. Compared with land species, threat levels are higher among marine
  mammals, driven by different processes (accidental mortality and pollution,
  rather than habitat loss), and are spatially distinct (peaking in northern
  oceans, rather than in Southeast Asia). Marine mammals are also
  disproportionately poorly known. These data are made freely available to
  support further scientific developments and conservation action.%

    Functional diversity is the diversity of species traits in ecosystems. This
  concept is increasingly used in ecological research, yet its formal
  definition and measurements are currently under discussion. As the overall
  behavior and consistency of functional diversity indices have not been
  described so far, the novice user risks choosing an inaccurate index or a set
  of redundant indices to represent functional diversity. In our study we
  closely examine functional diversity indices to clarify their accuracy,
  consistency, and independence. Following current theory, we categorize them
  into functional richness, evenness, or divergence indices. We considered
  existing indices as well as new indices developed in this study. The new
  indices aimed at remedying the weaknesses of currently used indices (e.g., by
  taking into account intraspecific variability). Using virtual data sets, we
  test (1) whether indices respond to community changes as expected from their
  category and (2) whether the indices within each category are consistent and
  independent of indices from other categories. We also test the accuracy of
  methods proposed for the use of categorical traits. Most classical functional
  richness indices either failed to describe functional richness or were
  correlated with functional divergence indices. We therefore recommend using
  the new functional richness indices that consider intraspecific variability
  and thus empty space in the functional niche space. In contrast, most
  functional evenness and divergence indices performed well with respect to all
  proposed tests. For categorical variables, we do not recommend blending
  discrete and real-valued traits (except for indices based on distance
  measures) since functional evenness and divergence have no transposable
  meaning for discrete traits. Nonetheless, species diversity indices can be
  applied to categorical traits (using trait levels instead of species) in
  order to describe functional richness and equitability.%

    Aim: Both theory and empirical data suggest that life histories of insular
  species slow down (the " island syndrome "). Insular individuals are
  hypothesized to lay smaller clutches of larger eggs compared with individuals
  belonging to closely related main-land species. Most lizards have variable
  clutch sizes and can lay any number between one egg and a species-specific
  maximum which can be well over 50 eggs. Many lizards, such as geckos and
  anoles, however, lay invariant small clutches of one or two eggs, and may
  thus be unable to manifest some aspects of the island syndrome. We tested
  whether insular species with either variable or invariant clutch sizes
  respond to insu-larity differently. Location: Worldwide. Methods: We
  assembled data on egg, clutch, hatchling and female sizes and brood
  frequencies of 2,511 lizard species. We tested whether the predictions of the
  island syndrome were met for lizards laying invariant versus variable
  clutches, controlling for female size and phylogenetic non-independence. We
  further examined whether geckos and anoles, the major clades with invariant
  clutches, differ from other lizards in the way they respond to insularity.
  Results: On islands, species with variable clutch sizes lay smaller clutches
  of larger eggs, from which larger hatchlings emerge, compared with mainland
  species. Lizards with invariant clutch sizes, however, decrease clutch size
  and increase clutch frequency but not hatchling or egg size, compared with
  mainland species. Main conclusions: Lizards with invariant clutch sizes may
  be unable to increase egg and hatchling sizes because of limitations set by
  the female body cavity and pelvic opening, or by arboreality. They
  nonetheless lay smaller clutches on islands and increase clutch frequency. We
  suggest that this may result from lower seasonality of tropical islands,
  leading to a greater spread of reproductive effort. Alternatively, the higher
  clutch frequency on tropical islands could result from fluctuations in
  pop-ulation densities caused by tropical storms.%

  but weak, effect of body size on functioning. The effect was much stronger
  when considering the effect of body size within trophic position levels.
  Compared to extinctions ordered by body size, random extinction sequences had
  lower multiple species loss effects on functioning. Our study is the first to
  show experimentally, in multitrophic systems, a more negative impact of
  ordered extinction sequences on ecosystem functioning than random losses. Our
  results suggest apparent ease in predicting species loss effect on
  functioning based on easily measured ecological traits that are body size and
  trophic position.%

    Birds are one of the most diverse groups of ecosystem service providers,
  whose ecological functions range from creating soil to shaping primate
  behavior, Nevertheless, the impression that birds have little influence on
  ecological processes has been hard to change. Given the ongoing declines in
  avian functional groups, there is a pressing need to compare avian ecological
  functions to those of other taxa, to understand how these functions translate
  to ecosystem services and to estimate the ecological implications of bird
  declines. Here, I review the ecological functions of birds, link them to
  ecosystem services and outline research priorities for understanding avian

    A review of published data on the ecology of terrestrial vertebrates and,
  partly, fishes is used as a basis to show that their communities have only a
  weak relationship to the structure of phytocenoses. Unlike plants,
  vertebrates actively choose preferable biotopes and do not die off upon
  transition between the stages of succession. The role of vertebrates in the
  functioning of ecosystems is determined by their contribution to matter and
  energy turnover and effect on the structure of ecosystems of different ranks.
  The transfer of matter and energy in food chains accelerates their turnover,
  and the distribution of excrements and corpses within the ranges of animal
  activity and migrations modulates the pattern of matter and energy fluxes
  over the Earth's surface. The spread of plant diaspores by animals and the
  burrowing and feeding activities of first-order consumers give rise to
  microsuccessions within macrosuccession stages, thereby contributing to the
  diversity of vegetation. In some cases, the activities of first-order
  consumers may result in the cessation of succession.%

    Aim A major Late Quaternary vertebrate extinction event affected mostly
  large-bodied ‘megafauna'. This is well documented in both mammals and
  birds, but evidence of a similar trend in reptiles is scant. We assess the
  relationship between body size and Late Quaternary extinction in reptiles at
  the global level. Location Global. Methods We compile a body size database
  for all 82 reptile species that are known to have gone extinct during the
  last 50,000 years and compare them with the sizes of 10,090 extant reptile
  species (97% of known extant diversity). We assess the body size
  distributions in the major reptile groups: crocodiles, lizards, snakes and
  turtles, while testing and correcting for a size bias in the fossil record.
  We examine geographical biases in extinction by contrasting mainland and
  insular reptile assemblages, and testing for biases within regions and then
  globally by using geographically weighted models. Results Extinct reptiles
  were larger than extant ones, but there was considerable variation in
  extinction size biases among groups. Extinct lizards and turtles were large,
  extinct crocodiles were small and there was no trend in snakes. Lizard
  lineages vary in the way their extinction is related to size. Extinctions
  were particularly prevalent on islands, with 73 of the 82 extinct species
  being island endemics. Four others occurred in Australia. The fossil record
  is biased towards large-bodied reptiles, but extinct lizards were larger than
  extant ones even after we account for this. Main conclusions Body size played
  a complex role in the extinction of Late Quaternary reptiles. Larger lizard
  and turtle species were clearly more affected by extinction mechanisms such
  as over exploitation and invasive species, resulting in a prevalence of
  large-bodied species among extinct taxa. Insularity was by far the strongest
  correlate of recent reptile extinctions, suggesting that size-biased
  extinction mechanisms are amplified in insular environments.%

    Animal populations have undergone substantial declines in recent decades.
  These declines have occurred alongside rapid, human‐driven environmental
  change, including climate warming. An association between population declines
  and environmental change is well established, yet there has been relatively
  little analysis of the importance of the rates of climate warming and its
  interaction with conversion to anthropogenic land use in causing population
  declines. Here we present a global assessment of the impact of rapid climate
  warming and anthropogenic land use conversion on 987 populations of 481
  species of terrestrial birds and mammals since 1950. We collated spatially
  referenced population trends of at least 5 years' duration from the Living
  Planet database and used mixed effects models to assess the association of
  these trends with observed rates of climate warming, rates of conversion to
  anthropogenic land use, body mass, and protected area coverage. We found that
  declines in population abundance for both birds and mammals are greater in
  areas where mean temperature has increased more rapidly, and that this effect
  is more pronounced for birds. However, we do not find a strong effect of
  conversion to anthropogenic land use, body mass, or protected area coverage.
  Our results identify a link between rapid warming and population declines,
  thus supporting the notion that rapid climate warming is a global threat to
  biodiversity.%

    Animal lifespan is determined by extrinsic and intrinsic factors causing
  mortality. According to the evolutionary theories of senescence, when
  mortality pressures are low, animals delay reproduction. This enables species
  to grow more slowly and, consequently, natural selection can act against
  harmful mutations in adulthood, thereby increasing lifespans. To test
  predictions of these theories we assembled a dataset on the maximum
  longevities and relevant ecological variables of 1320 reptilian species.
  Correcting for phylogeny, we modelled the link between reptile longevity and
  factors such as body size, microhabitat, activity period, insularity, annual
  temperature, temperature seasonality, elevation and clutch size that we
  hypothesized will affect extrinsic mortality rates and hence lifespan. Body
  mass explained a small proportion of the variance in reptile longevity.
  Species living on islands, and in colder and more seasonal environments,
  lived longer. Observed maximum longevity was positively associated with the
  number of individuals used to estimate it. Our results suggest that species
  exposed to reduced extrinsic and intrinsic mortality pressures (lower
  predation, lower metabolic rates and shorter activity periods) live longer.
  Sampling more individuals increases the chances of finding older specimens
  and should be corrected for when studying maximum longevity. ADDITIONAL

    The Great Acceleration' graphs, originally published in 2004 to show
  socio-economic and Earth System trends from 1750 to 2000, have now been
  updated to 2010. In the graphs of socio-economic trends, where the data
  permit, the activity of the wealthy (OECD) countries, those countries with
  emerging economies, and the rest of the world have now been differentiated.
  The dominant feature of the socio-economic trends is that the economic
  activity of the human enterprise continues to grow at a rapid rate. However,
  the differentiated graphs clearly show that strong equity issues are masked
  by considering global aggregates only. Most of the population growth since
  1950 has been in the non-OECD world but the world's economy (GDP), and hence
  consumption, is still strongly dominated by the OECD world. The Earth System
  indicators, in general, continued their long-term, post-industrial rise,
  although a few, such as atmospheric methane concentration and stratospheric
  ozone loss, showed a slowing or apparent stabilisation over the past decade.
  The post-1950 acceleration in the Earth System indicators remains clear. Only
  beyond the mid-20th century is there clear evidence for fundamental shifts in
  the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of
  variability of the Holocene and driven by human activities. Thus, of all the
  candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great
  Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science
  perspective.%

    MOTIVATION: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is
  often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the
  analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing
  value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of
  available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only:
  continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are
  usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible
  relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which
  can cope with different types of variables simultaneously. RESULTS: We
  compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing
  values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest)
  based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or
  regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple
  imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random
  forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a
  test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse
  selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values
  ranging from 10% to 30%. We show that missForest can successfully handle
  missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of
  variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of
  imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and
  non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates
  of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest
  exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with
  high-dimensional data. AVAILABILITY: The package missForest is freely

    The first global assessment of amphibians provides new context for the
  well-publicized phenomenon of amphibian declines. Amphibians are more
  threatened and are declining more rapidly than either birds or mammals.
  Although many declines are due to habitat loss and overutilization, other,
  unidentified processes threaten 48\% of rapidly declining species and are
  driving species most quickly to extinction. Declines are nonrandom in terms
  of species' ecological preferences, geographic ranges, and taxonomic
  associations and are most prevalent among Neotropical montane,
  stream-associated species. The lack of conservation remedies for these poorly
  understood declines means that hundreds of amphibian species now face
  extinction.%

    Continental-scale maps of plant functional diversity are a fundamental
  piece of data of interest to ecosystem modelers and ecologists, yet such maps
  have been exceedingly hard to generate. The large effort to compile global
  plant functional trait databases largely for the purpose of mapping and
  analyzing the spatial distribution of function has resulted in very sparse
  data matrices thereby limiting progress. Identifying robust methodologies to
  gap fill or impute trait values in these databases is an important objective.
  Here I argue that existing statistical tools from phylogenetic comparative
  methods can be used to rapidly impute values into global plant functional
  trait databases due to the large amount of phylogenetic signal often in trait
  data. In particular, statistical models of phylogenetic signal in traits can
  be generated from existing data and used to predict missing values of closely
  related species often with a high degree of accuracy thereby facilitating the
  continental-scale mapping of plant function. Despite the promise of this
  approach, I also discuss potential pitfalls and future challenges that will
  need to be addressed.%

    Our understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem
  functioning (BEF) applies mainly to fine spatial scales. New research is
  required if we are to extend this knowledge to broader spatial scales that
  are relevant for conservation decisions. Here, we use simulations to examine
  conditions that generate scale dependence of the BEF relationship. We study
  scale by assessing how the BEF relationship (slope and R2) changes when
  habitat patches are spatially aggregated. We find three ways for the BEF
  relationship to be scale-dependent: (i) variation among local patches in
  local ($\alpha$) diversity, (ii) spatial variation in the local BEF
  relationship and (iii) incomplete compositional turnover in species
  composition among patches. The first two cause the slope of the BEF
  relationship to increase moderately with spatial scale, reflecting nonlinear
  averaging of spatial variation in diversity or the BEF relationship. The
  third mechanism results in much stronger scale dependence, with the BEF
  relationship increasing in the rising portion of the species area
  relationship, but then decreasing as it saturates. An analysis of data from
  the Cedar Creek grassland BEF experiment revealed a positive but saturating
  slope of the relationship with scale. Overall, our findings suggest that the
  BEF relationship is likely to be scale dependent.%

    Despite the recognized joint impact of climate and land cover change on
  facets of biodiversity and their associated functions, risk assessments have
  primarily evaluated impacts on species ranges and richness. Here we quantify
  the sensitivity of the functional structure of European avian assemblages to
  changes in both regional climate and land cover. We combine species range
  forecasts with functional-trait information. We show that species sensitivity
  to environmental change is randomly distributed across the functional tree of
  the European avifauna and that functionally unique species are not
  disproportionately threatened by 2080. However, projected species range
  changes will modify the mean species richness and functional diversity of
  bird diets and feeding behaviours. This will unequally affect the spatial
  structure of functional diversity, leading to homogenization across Europe.
  Therefore, global changes may alter the functional structure of species
  assemblages in the future in ways that need to be accounted for in
  conservation planning.%

    ▪ Abstract Vertebrate dispersal of fruits and seeds is a common feature
  of many modern angiosperms and gymnosperms, yet the evolution and frequency
  of this feature in the fossil record remain unclear. Increasingly complex
  information suggests that (a) plants had the necessary morphological features
  for vertebrate dispersal by the Pennsylvanian, but possibly in the absence of
  clear vertebrate dispersal agents; (b) vertebrate herbivores first
  diversified in the Permian, and consistent dispersal relationships became
  possible; (c) the Mesozoic was dominated by large herbivorous dinosaurs,
  possible sources of diffuse, whole-plant dispersal; (d) simultaneously,
  several groups of small vertebrates, including lizards and, in the later
  Mesozoic, birds and mammals, could have established more specific
  vertebrate-plant associations, but supporting evidence is rudimentary; and
  (e) the diversification of small mammals and birds in the Tertiary
  established a consistent basis for organ-level interactions, allowing for the
  widespread occurrence of biotic dispersal in gymnosperms and angiosperms.%

    ONE of the ecological tenets justifying conservation of biodiversity is
  that diversity begets stability. Impacts of biodiversity on population
  dynamics and ecosystem functioning have long been debated1-7, however, with
  many theoretical explorations2-6,8-11 but few field studies12-15. Here we
  describe a long-term study of grasslands16,17 which shows that primary
  productivity in more diverse plant communities is more resistant to, and
  recovers more fully from, a major drought. The curvilinear relationship we
  observe suggests that each additional species lost from our grasslands had a
  progressively greater impact on drought resistance. Our results support the
  diversity-stability hypothesis5,6,18,19, but not the alternative hypothesis
  that most species are functionally redundant19-21. This study implies that
  the preservation of biodiversity is essential for the maintenance of stable
  productivity in ecosystems.%

    Species diversity is a major determinant of ecosystem productivity,
  stability, invasibility, and nutrient dynamics. Hundreds of studies spanning
  terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures
  are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and
  that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher
  diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity,
  greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and
  nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates
  over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are
  consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a
  common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term
  coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect
  as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought,
  nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change.
  The preservation, conservation, and restoration of biodiversity should be a
  high global priority.%

    Over the last 25 years, research on biodiversity has expanded dramatically,
  fuelled by increasing threats to the natural world. However, the number of
  published studies is heavily weighted towards certain taxa, perhaps
  influencing conservation awareness of and funding for less-popular groups.
  Few studies have systematically quantified these biases, although information
  on this topic is important for informing future research and conservation
  priorities. We investigated: i) which animal taxa are being studied; ii) if
  any taxonomic biases are the same in temperate and tropical regions; iii)
  whether the taxon studied is named in the title of papers on biodiversity,
  perhaps reflecting a perception of what biodiversity is; iv) the geographical
  distribution of biodiversity research, compared with the distribution of
  biodiversity and threatened species; and v) the geographical distribution of
  authors' countries of origin. To do this, we used the search engine Web of
  Science to systematically sample a subset of the published literature with
  ‘biodiversity' in the title. In total 526 research papers were
  screened—5% of all papers in Web of Science with biodiversity in the title.
  For each paper, details on taxonomic group, title phrasing, number of
  citations, study location, and author locations were recorded. Compared to
  the proportions of described species, we identified a considerable taxonomic
  weighting towards vertebrates and an under-representation of invertebrates
  (particularly arachnids and insects) in the published literature. This
  discrepancy is more pronounced in highly cited papers, and in tropical
  regions, with only 43% of biodiversity research in the tropics including
  invertebrates. Furthermore, while papers on vertebrate taxa typically did not
  specify the taxonomic group in the title, the converse was true for
  invertebrate papers. Biodiversity research is also biased geographically:
  studies are more frequently carried out in developed countries with larger
  economies, and for a given level of species or threatened species, tropical
  countries were understudied relative to temperate countries. Finally,
  biodiversity research is disproportionately authored by researchers from
  wealthier countries, with studies less likely to be carried out by scientists
  in lower-GDP nations. Our results highlight the need for a more systematic
  and directed evaluation of biodiversity studies, perhaps informing more
  targeted research towards those areas and taxa most depauperate in research.
  Only by doing so can we ensure that biodiversity research yields results that
  are relevant and applicable to all regions and that the information necessary
  for the conservation of threatened species is available to conservation
  practitioners.%

    MOTIVATION: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets
  with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately, many algorithms for
  gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as
  input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means
  clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even
  with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed,
  therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to
  increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In
  this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data.
  RESULTS: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation
  of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three
  methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute),
  weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the
  methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data
  sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of
  missing data over the range of 1--20% missing values. We show that KNNimpute
  appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value
  estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the
  commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with
  zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide
  recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data
  under a variety of conditions.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Animal movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species
  survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on animal movements
  have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database
  of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in
  areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to
  one-third the extent of their movements in areas with a low human footprint.
  We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual animals and
  to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher
  human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of
  animals that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem
  processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease
  transmission. W ith approximately 50 to 70% of Earth's land surface currently
  modified for human activities (1), patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem
  functions worldwide are changing (2). The expanding footprint of human
  activities not only is causing the loss of habitat and biodiversity, but is
  also affecting how animals move through fragmented and disturbed habitats.
  The extent to which animal movements are affected by anthropogenic effects on
  the structure and composition of landscapes and resource changes has been
  explored only in local geographic regions or within single species. Such
  studies typically report decreasing animal movements-for example, as a result
  of habitat fragmentation, barrier effects, or resource changes (3-6)-with
  only a few studies reporting longer movements as a result of habitat loss or
  altered migration routes (7, 8). We conducted a global comparative study of
  how the human footprint affects movements of terrestrial nonvolant mammals,
  using Global Positioning System (GPS) location data of 803 individuals from
  57 mammal species (Fig. 1 and table S2). Mean species mass ranged from 0.49
  to 3940 kg and included herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores (n = 28, 11,
  and 18 species, respectively). For each individual, we annotated locations
  with the Human Footprint Index (HFI), an index with a global extent that
  combines multiple proxies of human influence: the extent of built
  environments, crop land, pasture land, human population density, nighttime
  lights, railways, roads, and navigable waterways (9) (see supplementary
  materials for details). The HFI ranges from 0 (natural environments: e.g.,
  the Brazilian Pantanal) to 50 (high-density built environments: e.g., New
  York City). In addition to the human footprint, we included other covariates
  that are known to influence mammalian movements. Because individuals may need
  to cover a larger area to gather sufficient resources, mammals generally move
  farther in environments with lower productivity (10). To capture this effect,
  we annotated locations with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
  (NDVI), a well-established, satellite-derived measure of resource abundance
  for both herbivores and car-nivores (11). Because an allometric scaling
  relationship shows that animals of greater body size usually move farther
  (12), and because diet may influence movements as a result of differences in
  foraging costs and availability of resource types (13, 14), we annotated the
  database with species averages for body size and dietary guild (i.e.,
  car-nivore, herbivore, or omnivore). We then calculated displacements as the
  distance between subsequent GPS locations of each individual at nine time
  scales (15) ranging from 1 hour to 10 days. For each individual at each time
  scale, we calculated the 0.5 and 0.95 quan-tile of displacement. The
  combination of different time scales and quantile allowed us to examine the
  effect of the human footprint on both the median (0.5 quantile) and
  long-distance (0.95 quan-tile) movements for within-day movements (e.g.,
  1-hour time scale) up to longer time displacements of more than 1 week (e.g.,
  10-day time scale). We used linear mixed-effects models that, in addition to
  all covariates (i.e., NDVI, body mass, diet), also accounted for taxonomy and
  spatial autocorrelation (see supplementary materials for details). We found
  strong negative effects of the human footprint on median and long-distance
  displacements of terrestrial mammals (Fig. 2, Fig. 3A, and table S3).
  Displacements of individuals (across species) living in areas of high
  footprint (HFI = 36) were shorter than displacements of individuals living in
  areas of low footprint (HFI = 0) by as much as a factor of 3. For example,
  median displacements for carnivores over 10 days were 3.3 ± 1.4 km (SE) in
  areas of high footprint versus 6.9 ± 1.3 km in areas of low footprint (Fig.
  2A and table S3). Likewise, the maximum displacement distances for carnivores
  at the 10-day scale averaged 6.6 ± 1.4 km in areas of high footprint versus
  21.5 ± 1.4 km in areas of low footprint (Fig. 2B and table S3). The effect
  was significant on all temporal scales with 8 hours or more between
  locations.%

    Aim: Lizards are ancestrally diurnal, and most of them remain so.
  Nocturnality is common among lizards, but the environmental factors
  associated with lizard nocturnal activity are still unknown. Here, we
  contrasted the ambient temperature and productivity hypotheses, where we
  predicted that cold temperatures will pose a stonger limit to nocturnal
  species richness than diurnal lizards. Moreover, we contrasted the relative
  importance of annual, day and night mean temperatures to pinpoint the drivers
  of nocturnal lizard richness. Location:Mainland Eurasia. Methods: We
  collected distribution range and activity time data for all 1,113 lizard
  species found throughout mainland Eurasia. This represents the largest
  geographical scope to date, for studies of lizard species richness. We
  examined the spatial patterns of nocturnal species richness in relationship
  to diurnal species richness across environmental gradients of ambient
  temperature and productivity. Results: Nocturnal lizards are richest in the
  tropics and in deserts, and their richness decreases with latitude. However,
  nocturnal lizards are absent from the highest latitudes and coldest regions
  inhabited by lizards. Diurnal and nocturnal lizards respond in a similar
  manner to climatic factors. Ambient temperature has a strong influence on
  both, whereas productivity is more tightly related to the proportion of
  nocturnal species. Main conclusions: Nocturnality is widespread among
  Eurasian lizards. However, nocturnal lizards are absent from invariably cold
  regions, and low temperatures seem to be a limiting factor for lizard
  activity period. We suggest that the year-round warm nights of the tropics
  reduce the cost of being active at night and open the nocturnal niche for
  many lizards. In hot deserts, the combination of hot days and aridity
  increases the cost of diurnal activity, whereas nocturnal activity provides a
  shelter from these extreme conditions.%

    Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of
  ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the
  functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which
  are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the
  criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be
  designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and
  measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices
  to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species
  distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness
  (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional
  evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and
  functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this
  volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull
  volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum
  spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional
  space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species
  abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is
  measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their
  distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the
  functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria
  required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set
  of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of
  artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and
  functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three
  functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our
  study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three
  primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and
  for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This
  decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on
  ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on
  the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework
  for applying these three functional diversity indices.%

    In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal
  performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for
  a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and
  ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original
  boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging
  from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to
  fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high
  degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but
  also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an
  unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on
  functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the
  “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are
  defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly
  via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components
  of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework
  explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are
  translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence
  processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved
  by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into
  functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level)
  algorithms.%

    Despite being recognized as a promoter of diversity and a condition for
  local coexistence decades ago, the importance of intraspecific variance has
  been neglected over time in community ecology. Recently, there has been a new
  emphasis on intraspecific variability. Indeed, recent developments in
  trait-based community ecology have underlined the need to integrate variation
  at both the intraspecific as well as interspecific level. We introduce new
  T-statistics ('T' for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and
  interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to
  operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology
  theory. We show that a focus on the distribution of traits at local and
  regional scales combined with original analytical tools can provide unique
  insights into the primary forces structuring communities. {\textcopyright}

    The accumulation of seeds in the soil (the seedbank) can set the template
  for the early regeneration of habitats following disturbance. Seed dispersal
  is an important factor determining the pattern of seed rain, which affects
  the interactions those seeds experience. For this reason, seed dispersal
  should play an important role in structuring forest seedbanks, yet we know
  little about how that happens. Using the functional extirpation of
  frugivorous vertebrates from the island of Guam, together with two nearby
  islands (Saipan and Rota) that each support relatively intact disperser
  assemblages, we aimed to identify the role of vertebrate dispersers in
  structuring forest seedbanks. We sampled the seedbank on Guam where
  dispersers are absent, and compared this with the seedbank on Saipan and Rota
  where they are present. Almost twice as many species found in the seedbank on
  Guam, when compared with Saipan and Rota, had a conspecific adult within 2 m.
  This indicates a strong role of vertebrate dispersal in determining the
  identity of seeds in the seedbank. In addition, on Guam, a greater proportion
  of samples contained no seeds and overall species richness was lower than on
  Saipan. Differences in seed abundance and richness between Guam and Rota were
  less clear, as seedbanks on Rota also contained fewer species than Saipan,
  possibly due to increased post-dispersal seed predation. Our findings suggest
  that vertebrate seed dispersers can have a strong influence on the species
  composition of seedbanks. Regardless of post-dispersal processes, without
  dispersal, seedbanks no longer serve to increase the species pool of recruits
  during regeneration.%

    Climate change vulnerability assessments are commonly used to identify
  species at risk from global climate change, but the wide range of
  methodologies available makes it difficult for end users, such as
  conservation practitioners or policymakers, to decide which method to use as
  a basis for decision-making. In this study, we evaluate whether different
  assessments consistently assign species to the same risk categories and
  whether any of the existing methodologies perform well at identifying
  climate-threatened species. We compare the outputs of 12 climate change
  vulnerability assessment methodologies, using both real and simulated
  species, and validate the methods using historic data for British birds and
  butterflies (i.e. using historical data to assign risks and more recent data
  for validation). Our results show that the different vulnerability assessment
  methods are not consistent with one another; different risk categories are
  assigned for both the real and simulated sets of species. Validation of the
  different vulnerability assessments suggests that methods incorporating
  historic trend data into the assessment perform best at predicting
  distribution trends in subsequent time periods. This study demonstrates that
  climate change vulnerability assessments should not be used interchangeably
  due to the poor overall agreement between methods when considering the same
  species. The results of our validation provide more support for the use of
  trend-based rather than purely trait-based approaches, although further
  validation will be required as data become available.%

    The ability to predict the responses of ecological communities and
  individual species to human-induced environmental change remains a key issue
  for ecologists and conservation managers alike. Responses are often variable
  among species within groups making general predictions difficult. One option
  is to include ecological trait information that might help to disentangle
  patterns of response and also provide greater understanding of how particular
  traits link whole clades to their environment. Although this "trait-guild"
  approach has been used for single disturbances, the importance of particular
  traits on general responses to multiple disturbances has not been explored.
  We used a mixed model analysis of 19 data sets from throughout the world to
  test the effect of ecological and life-history traits on the responses of bee
  species to different types of anthropogenic environmental change. These
  changes included habitat loss, fragmentation, agricultural intensification,
  pesticides and fire. Individual traits significantly affected bee species
  responses to different disturbances and several traits were broadly
  predictive among multiple disturbances. The location of nests - above vs.
  below ground - significantly affected response to habitat loss, agricultural
  intensification, tillage regime (within agriculture) and fire. Species that
  nested above ground were on average more negatively affected by isolation
  from natural habitat and intensive agricultural land use than were species
  nesting below ground. In contrast below-ground-nesting species were more
  negatively affected by tilling than were above-ground nesters. The response
  of different nesting guilds to fire depended on the time since the burn.
  Social bee species were more strongly affected by isolation from natural
  habitat and pesticides than were solitary bee species. Surprisingly, body
  size did not consistently affect species responses, despite its importance in
  determining many aspects of individuals' interaction with their environment.
  Although synergistic interactions among traits remain to be explored,
  individual traits can be useful in predicting and understanding responses of
  related species to global change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    To accommodate climate-driven changes in biological communities,
  conservation plans are increasingly making use of models to predict species'
  responses to climate change. To date, species distribution models have been
  the most commonly used approach for assessing species' vulnerability to
  climate change. Biological trait-based approaches, which have emerged
  recently, and which include consideration of species' sensitivity and
  adaptive capacity, provide alternative and potentially conflicting
  vulnerability assessments and present conservation practitioners and planners
  with difficult choices. Here we discuss the differing objectives and
  strengths of the approaches, and provide guidance to conservation
  practitioners for their application. We outline an integrative methodological
  framework for assessing climate change impacts on species that uses both
  traditional species distribution modelling approaches and biological
  trait-based assessments. We show how these models can be used conceptually as
  inputs to guide conservation monitoring and planning.%

    Species are characterized by physiological, behavioral, and ecological
  attributes that are all subject to varying evolutionary and ecological
  constraints and jointly detemrine species' role and function in ecosystems.
  Attributes such as diet, foraging strata, foraging time, and body size, in
  particular, characterize a large portion of the "Eltonian" niches of species.
  Here we present a global species-level compilation of these key attributes
  for all 9993 and 5400 extant bird and mammal species derived from key
  literature sources. Global handbooks and monographs allowed the consistent
  sourcing of attributes for most species. For diet and foraging stratum we
  followed a defined protocol to translate the verbal descriptions into
  standardized, semiquantitative information about relative importance of
  different categories. Together with body size (continuous) and activity time
  (categorical) this enables a much finer distinction of species' foraging
  ecology than typical categorical guild assignments allow. Attributes lacking
  information for specific species are flagged, and interpolated values based
  on taxonomy are provided instead.The presented data set is limited by, among
  others, these select cases missing observed data, by errors and uncertainty
  in the expert assessment as presented in the literature, and by the lack of
  intraspecific information. However, the standardized and transparent nature
  and complete global coverage of the data set should support an array of
  potential studies in biogeography, community ecology, macroevolution, global
  change biology, and conservation. Potential uses include comparative work
  involving these traits as focal or secondary variables, ecological research
  on the trait or trophic structure of communities, or conservation science
  concerned with the loss of function among species or in ecosystems in a
  changing world. We hope that this publication will spur the sharing,
  collaborative curation, and extension of data to the benefit of a more
  integrative, rigorous, and global biodiversity science.%

    Recent advances in the ecology of food webs underscore the importance of
  detritus and indirect predator-prey effects. However, most research considers
  detritus as an invariable pool and predation as the only interaction between
  carnivores and prey. Carrion consumption, scavenging, is a type of detrital
  feeding that should have widespread consequences for the structure and
  stability of food webs. Providing access to high-quality resources,
  facultative scavenging is a ubiquitous and phylogenetically widespread
  strategy. In this review, we argue that scavenging is underestimated by
  16-fold in food-web research, producing inflated predation rates and
  underestimated indirect effects. Furthermore, more energy is generally
  transferred per link via scavenging than predation. Thus, future food-web
  research should consider scavenging, especially in light of how major global
  changes can affect scavengers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.%

    In focusing on how organisms' generalizable functional properties (traits)
  interact mechanistically with environments across spatial scales and levels
  of biological organization, trait-based approaches provide a powerful
  framework for attaining synthesis, generality and prediction. Trait-based
  research has considerably improved understanding of the assembly, structure
  and functioning of plant communities. Further advances in ecology may be
  achieved by exploring the trait-environment relationships of non-sessile,
  heterotrophic organisms such as terrestrial arthropods, which are
  geographically ubiquitous, ecologically diverse, and often important
  functional components of ecosystems. Trait-based studies and trait databases
  have recently been compiled for groups such as ants, bees, beetles,
  butterflies, spiders and many others; however, the explicit justification,
  conceptual framework, and primary-evidence base for the burgeoning field of
  'terrestrial arthropod trait-based ecology' have not been well established.
  Consequently, there is some confusion over the scope and relevance of this
  field, as well as a tendency for studies to overlook important assumptions of
  the trait-based approach. Here we aim to provide a broad and accessible
  overview of the trait-based ecology of terrestrial arthropods. We first
  define and illustrate foundational concepts in trait-based ecology with
  respect to terrestrial arthropods, and justify the application of trait-based
  approaches to the study of their ecology. Next, we review studies in
  community ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to elucidate
  how assembly processes for terrestrial arthropod communities are influenced
  by niche filtering along environmental gradients (e.g. climatic, structural,
  and land-use gradients) and by abiotic and biotic disturbances (e.g. fire,
  floods, and biological invasions). We also review studies in ecosystem
  ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to investigate
  biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships: how the functional diversity
  of arthropod communities relates to a host of ecosystem functions and
  services that they mediate, such as decomposition, pollination and predation.
  We then suggest how future work can address fundamental assumptions and
  limitations by investigating trait functionality and the effects of
  intraspecific variation, assessing the potential for sampling methods to bias
  the traits and trait values observed, and enhancing the quality and
  consolidation of trait information in databases. A roadmap to guide
  observational trait-based studies is also presented. Lastly, we highlight new
  areas where trait-based studies on terrestrial arthropods are well positioned
  to advance ecological understanding and application. These include examining
  the roles of competitive, non-competitive and (multi-)trophic interactions in
  shaping coexistence, and macro-scaling trait-environment relationships to
  explain and predict patterns in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across
  space and time. We hope this review will spur and guide future applications
  of the trait-based framework to advance ecological insights from the most
  diverse eukaryotic organisms on Earth.%

    Trophic interactions play critical roles in structuring biotic communities.
  Understanding variation in trophic interactions among systems provides
  important insights into biodiversity maintenance and conservation. However,
  the relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down trophic processes for
  broad-scale patterns in biodiversity is poorly understood. Here, we used
  global datasets on species richness of vascular plants, mammals and breeding
  birds to evaluate the role of trophic interactions in shaping large-scale
  diversity patterns. Specifically, we used non-recursive structural equation
  models to test for top-down and bottom-up forcing of global species diversity
  patterns among plants and trophic guilds of mammals and birds (carnivores,
  invertivores and herbivores), while accounting for extrinsic environmental
  drivers. The results show that trophic linkages emerged as being more
  important to explaining species richness than extrinsic environmental
  drivers. In particular, there were strong, positive top-down interactions
  between mammal herbivores and plants, and moderate to strong bottom-up and/or
  top-down interactions between herbivores/invertivores and carnivores.
  Estimated trophic interactions for separate biogeographical regions were
  consistent with global patterns. Our findings demonstrate that, after
  accounting for environmental drivers, large-scale species richness patterns
  in plant and vertebrate taxa consistently support trophic interactions
  playing a major role in shaping global patterns in biodiversity. Furthermore,
  these results suggest that top-down forces often play strong complementary
  roles relative to bottom-up drivers in structuring biodiversity patterns
  across trophic levels. These findings underscore the importance of
  integrating trophic forcing mechanisms into studies of biodiversity
  patterns.%
